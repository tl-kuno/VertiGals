# The North Shore VertiGals

Meet the [North Shore VertiGals](http://northshorevertigals.com), a climbing group for women identifying and non-binary climbers in Duluth, MN and surrounding area. While the group was getting established in the commmunity, they relied on simple website tools such as WordPress and Google Sites. After nearly 10 years of growing their group it was time to introduce a more modern site to help them stay connected and communicate their mission to a wider audience.

## The Creators

Board members [Taylor Kuno](portfoliolinkhere) and [Marta Daehn](portfoliolinkhere) joined forces to make this site come to life. With Marta's experience in UX/UI design and Taylor's knowledge as a developer the timing was right to build something more personal and robust to promote the work that VertiGals is doing and document the history of the organization.
