    Meet our October WCW Rachelle! Rachelle is a registered dietitian in the
    Twin Cities who we got the chance to climb with only days after her lead of
    Oz - (AKA The Road To Emerald City) at Palisade Head. When not crushing, she
    likes to belay for total strangers like me, eat vegetables, grow plants, be
    active, volunteer in her community, and travel! Read on to learn about her
    send of a Palisade classic, her excitement for learning about self-rescue,
    and dreams of travel post-pandemic.

                spending your free time?</strong
            ><br />For me, the best part of traveling is slowing down enough to
            explore the people, culture, food, and day to day life of new
            places. Limited travel due to the pandemic has given my partner and
            I a reason to do this at home in Minneapolis, setting out on long
            days with a loose agenda and a backpack full of snacks. We spent
            multiple days walking for hours through neighborhoods and areas we
            often don’t spend time, in the same way we do when we travel. There
            is so much beauty in the world when I remind myself to stop and
            enjoy it. Also, Palisade Head became my home away from home on
            weekends when I wasn’t working at the hospital.

                project Oz (AKA The Road to Emerald City) a 5.12b up the shore! </strong
            ><br />In 2019, I pledged to myself that I would say yes to every
            opportunity I was offered. Among many amazing experiences during
            this time, I got my first taste of climbing at Palisade Head. All of
            my yes’s in 2019 resulted in an unexpected amount of desire to learn
            more and expand my skill set - and in late fall, I told a handful of
            people about an impromptu goal of leading Oz on gear in 2020. A few
            were really psyched and some were really doubtful given my
            non-existent trad experience, which made me double down on my newly
            announced project.

            >
            naively agreed to sign onto the project with me, and as a team, we
            applied for a Live Your Dream grant through the American Alpine Club
            (which was not awarded to anyone due to COVID). As we talked about
            being a team, and the process, and bringing other women up with us,
            learning new skills and acknowledging where our personal weaknesses
            were, we found this project represented way more than just another
            climb on our resume.

                at Palisade? </strong
            ><br />The movement on this climb is incredible - a bit hard down
            low with sustained movement through a middle crack section that goes
            on for eternity. Also, a couple of bolts protect the bottom which
            minimizes decking potential and the line takes gear really well. I
            learned to trad climb while also performing near my physical max,
            and unintentionally tested out nearly all of the upper placements
            with some sizable whips (for the record: they all held, and I had A+
            belayers).

                >What has been the hardest part about working this
                project?</strong
            ><br />The most daunting part of the process was rappelling 180 feet
            to Lake Superior’s shore and knowing there was absolutely no easy
            way out. About two months into the season, I was on route, less than
            halfway up and really struggling to put forth a decent effort. Out
            loud, I asked myself if I really wanted this, and if I didn’t, to go
            home for good. I replied to myself, also out loud, “I came to
            f***ing party” and this became TeamLadyOz’s mantra - showing up
            fully committed and ready to put the work in. We stopped doubting
            the possibility of finishing this project after that weekend and
            trusted ourselves, our team and our abilities. And ultimately, we
            did it our way: we learned to trad climb on a route closer to our
            upper limit, placed hexes on route and used them for anchors, took
            whips on gear, took sh*t from nobody, told rude tourist assholes to
            **** off when they were treating us like zoo animals.

            ><br />The weekend prior to sending, I had back-to-back heart
            breaker attempts. My send go was calm and overdue, and I was so
            relieved when it was done. Double rainbows, dark clouds and
            sprinkles appeared shortly after!

                what was the best part of working Oz?</strong
            ><br />The best part of the project was getting to climb with Liz
            Horn consistently for a season, witnessing her process and belaying
            for her send. She’s been pushing boundaries in MN climbing for a
            long time, and with a FFA of Oz, she’s proven that she can do it
            across styles.<br />The best part of the process was building
            “Teamladyoz” in which everyone involved had important contributions.
            Teamladyoz provided a live example of women supporting women, and
            why representation matters in the community - people will aspire for
            bigger goals when they see themselves represented. And we still have
            so much work to do to make sure everyone can feel this.<br /><br />

            health issues associated with climbing and the experiences we may be
            a part of (or in my case, see friends be involved with). I owe it to
