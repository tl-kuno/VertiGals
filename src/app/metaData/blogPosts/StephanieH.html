    >This week’s #WCW is the woman (usually) behind Womxn Crush Wednesdays and
    one of the founding members of the VertiGals, Stephanie Hall. From the very
    beginning, Steph has been passionate about the VertiGals and has contributed
    countless creative ideas and countless hours to pull the group together and
    make it the success it has been.</span

<span style="font-weight: 400"
    >I met Steph in the gym in 2017, around the time when a few of us were
    mulling around the idea of a womens’ climbing group. Steph shared some of
    her experiences and really helped validate the need for a group like this.
    And, </span
><span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Steph is an inspiring climber who I've learned a lot from, usually over
    conversations during hikes and/or drinks. We connected about similar
    experiences and fears, and she has become a great friend. </span
>Steph also <span style="font-weight: 400"
    >brought a ton of energy into helping start the VertiGals, despite being
    pretty occupied already with her accelerated nursing program. Steph’s great
    creativity, organization, and follow-through as the secretary have been a
    huge asset - the North Shore VertiGals wouldn’t be here without her.</span

    >If you see Steph climbing at the gym, you’ll notice she’s got mad
    technique, great footwork, and makes climbing look easy. Steph applies her
    creativity to great route-setting at VED, and chances are you’ve enjoyed one
    of her balance-y routes at some point. Besides climbing, Steph enjoys
    hiking, reading, traveling, cross country skiing, playing volleyball, and
    hanging out with her family and family doggy, Malyshka, on Park Point. Steph
    just completed her post-bach degree in nursing at college of St. Scholastica
    and is moving out west for a position as a nurse in the Oncology &amp;
    Nephrology departments of a hospital. Luckily for us, her family is in
    Duluth so she’ll no doubt be back often, and she even wants to continue her
    involvement with the VertiGals and highlighting the amazing women crushers
    in our community every Wednesday!</span

    >What do you love about climbing?</b

<span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Climbing feels like a puzzle to me; I love the challenge of figuring out
    the balance, movement, power, and strength needed for a route, both indoors
    and out. I cannot adequately describe the positive emotion that radiates
    through me when I'm climbing well, it's like feeling beautiful, intelligent,
    strong, fierce and full of joy all at once, while covered in sweat, chalk,
    maybe a little blood, and peeling skin. I haven't found that feeling
    anywhere else. Couple that with being surrounded by beautiful rock and views
    and at least one good friend, and it’s pretty hard to beat.</span

<span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Palisade Head is unbeatable in my book; the views, the force of the lake
    and weather, and the variety of routes. I did make it a point to get to
    every crag in northern Minnesota this past summer, and every area has some
    jems and quality views, you really can’t go wrong. </span

<b>What non-climbing hobbies do you have?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Right now I'm recovering from shoulder surgery, so my biggest hobby (ha!)
    is rehabbing it so I can get back to climbing at full strength and
    functioning at normal levels in the the rest of life as soon as possible. I
    love to hike the Superior Hiking Trail (convenient since a few of the crags
    are along the SHT), read, travel, XC ski, write about amazing women in our
    community and always love a good nap in the sunshine.</span

<b>What made you get involved with VertiGals?</b
><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400"
    >I love my gym and the community in it, but I won't deny there were and are
    times that I felt I was treated differently because of my gender, especially
    as a beginner, and witnessed other women go through the same thing. Some of
    my negative experiences were from men often in the form of unwanted beta,
    completely ignoring or dismissing my abilities, dismissing my ideas or being
    told my technique wasn’t valid because it involved too much flexibility
    etc., which was frustrating and demeaning. Unfortunately, I also experienced
    some moments when certain women in the community weren’t kind or welcoming
    either. If I’m being totally honest there’s probably been moments in the
    past 8 years of climbing where I wasn’t very welcoming or encouraging, and
    for that I am truly sorry. I think as women we are unknowingly sold on the
    Scarcity fallacy, and we unconsciously believe it exists in climbing too;
    which is BULL$#!^. There is room for everyone to climb hard; someone else's
    achievements don’t diminish your own; someone else climbing better/harder
    than you doesn’t make you less of a climber; someone else knowing more than
    you doesn’t make what you know any less valuable; someone else having fun
    doesn’t mean there is any less fun for you to have. Recognizing that and
    recognizing and releasing our own internalized bull$#!^ means we let go of a
    lot of negativity and make room for the joy of getting to know each other,
    learning together, celebrating each other’s accomplishments (even when,
    ESPECIALLY when, they outpace our own), and just relish in the joy of
    spending time doing a thing you love together. The past few years I have
    really grown into this mindset, which has been the perfect pairing with
    VertiGals.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Entering a new hobby where your efforts and failures are on full display
    for everyone to see is HARD, it’s hard to feel comfortable trying hard,
    failing, or learning. There’s all sorts of new vocabulary, new tools, new
    ways to move your body, etc., and while it’s really fun and exciting, it can
    also be a scary and vulnerable space.  I wanted a space in which I could
    climb hard and learn from other women, lift up other women, share my
    experiences and love of climbing with other women, and reduce some of those
    uncomfortable moments. I think we are working hard to make VertiGals that
    type of space for everyone.</span

<b>How are you hoping to grow as a climber? </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400"
    >I’ll be 100% honest here, for the past 8 years of climbing I have been a
    scaredy cat and a mooch when it comes to learning how to actually climb
    safely outside in areas like Palisade Head. I have been happy to go with and
    completely trust other people who knew how to set anchors and how to manage
    our safety. I trusted my partners would make safe decisions, or at least I
    hoped they did. I think a big part of this came from fear of having to trust
    myself and the system I would create, knowing that my life, and whoever I
    was climbing with, would depend on it. I selfishly did not want that
    responsibility. I had that mindset for the first 5 years or so, and for the
    past couple years I have wanted to learn more, and wanted to gain my
    independence, but didn’t quite know how and still wasn't comfortable with
    the idea of trusting myself. I know I got lucky to have friends that would
    take me out despite my lack of knowledge or ability to help with certain
    aspects, but I also know I got lucky blindly trusting others with my safety
    when I wasn’t knowledgeable enough to check their work (yes I knew a bit of
    basic concepts but with trad anchors at Palisade there can be judgement
    calls and less than ideal anchor placements and in reality I had no ability
    to judge them on my own, I had to trust my partner). It’s not that any of my
    partners weren’t competent or were bad at building anchors but humans make
    mistakes, and mistakes are less likely to slip past two sets of
    knowledgeable eyes checking it out.
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Last year I climbed consistently with my friend Sam who slowly introduced
    bits of the puzzle, he didn’t let me slack off or just watch him build the
    achor, and for once I didn’t want to. He’s a great teacher and I learned a
    lot from him, and finally could see a point in the future where I could
    learn enough to trust myself. So now I’m halfway through the anchor building
    series of classes at UMD, am reading Climbing Anchors by John Long and Bob
    Gaines, and I can’t wait to finally take ownership of my own climbing and
    safety. (TL;DR: Anchor building! Safety and confidence outside!). Also, I
    really want to get on a multi-pitch soon.</span

<strong>How and why did you start WCW?</strong>

I originally wanted to write little blog posts on our board members to introduce
ourselves to the community, and then realized how many incredible, multifaceted
women are involved in our group, and realized this was something I wanted to
expand to everyone in our community. I have been inspired and challenged by
these women in the gym and getting to learn more about them and share their
responses has been a huge honor. Why do we do it? To lift each other up, to
celebrate the women in our communities accomplishments, creativity, strengths,
to see each other as more than climbers, to create a closer knit community, to
start conversations, to give a voice, to share experiences, to share challenges.

<b>How did you get started climbing? </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400"
    >My first climbing experience was at Wolf Ridge in 5th grade. I don’t
    remember if I even climbed. It was a non-event in my life. I also didn’t
    even make it past the second stage of the ropes course, so it’s safe to say
    I wasn’t exactly a fearless child at that age :)  My second experience was
    during my freshman year at college, my friend (Stacy!) and I started
    attending the Hamline’s climbing club outings to VE St. Paul. I remember
    being in awe of one of the club leaders, Brandy; she was tiny and so badass
    in my mind; she had climbed outside a bunch and had all this knowledge and
    epic stories, she taught us to belay, she was a beast in the gym. Climbing
    made me feel strong and empowered; and I loved flailing around on these
    routes that felt so tall at the time, struggling with even the tiniest bit
    of overhang, but despite the constant failure I felt strong and good.</span

    >Unfortunately, I ended up tearing a ligament in my foot playing volleyball,
    had to get 4 bones fused together and had a hard time even walking on uneven
    terrain for the next 2 years, so I thought climbing was something I would
    never do again. Eventually, I ended up back in Duluth and bored during one
    of the cold winter months, and my coworker Katie Challis and I decided we
    needed to try something new, so we looked up offerings at UMD, and found the </span

    >. Even though we weren’t students we were welcomed and had a great
    experience learning from other women (shout out to Amanda Meyers, and the
    whole program for being such a great experience).
</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400"
    >We eventually switched over to VE, started climbing with other coworkers,
    and started getting outside with them as well, and this time climbing stuck.
    I have had some amazing climbing partners over the years, Stacy, Katie,
    Jenna, Dan and the whole original and evolving EPA crew, Ryne, Shelby and
    everyone at Roca, Sam, all of the VertiGals, and countless others. Climbing
    is fun but has only turned into a passion because of the people I get to do
    it with and the mentorship that many have offered me. I am forever grateful
    for all of the experiences I’ve had and people I’ve shared them with, and I
    cannot wait to continue for years to come.

First outdoor lead climb, La Crosse, WI. PC Jenna Cavallin[/caption]

<b>What is something about your climbing history no one would ever guess?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400"
    >For the longest time I had ZERO interest in learning to lead climb. I saw a
    few people take some nasty falls in the gym within a couple month period and
    it just did not seem worth it to me. I finally learned at Roca, and loved
    it. I still hate lead climbing in VED, for some reason I never feel safe or
    like I’ll have a clean fall, but I’m still excited to get back to it when
    rehab allows and get leading more outside.</span
>

<b>What does the future entail for you?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400"
    >Recently I accepted a job in the Northwest and will be moving away from the
    VertiGals community in a few weeks. I am so grateful for all of the
    friendships I’ve made through VertiGals and am really proud of what this
    community has become. I hope to stay involved while I’m gone and hopefully
    continue contributing to the WCW blog from afar, but I am also excited to
    see the ways VertiGals will grow and evolve while I’m gone. I take comfort
    in the fact that I know I’ll have a wonderful community here if and when I
    decide to move back to our gorgeous area. In the meantime, I would love to
    have visitors and friends to go on climbing adventures with (there are SO
    many cool places to explore!), so hopefully I’ll see some of you out
    there!</span
