<h6>Interview written and compiled by Stephanie Hall</h6>
This weeks WCW is none other than the ball-of-energy that is Mikayla Haynes!
Mikayla is one of those people that has a million different passions and
talents; she's often working as a biologist, she really excited about birding,
she's in a band (<a href="http://instagram.com/cuckoobees_mn">@Cuckoobees_mn</a
>) in which she plays the xylophone, she's an artist and does graphic design
work (huge shout out to her for creating the VertiGals logo) as well as video
production (<a href="http://instagram.com/clydefoxcreative">@clydefoxcreative</a
>), she designs costumes, plays in partner acrobatics/acroyoga (check out
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1740736436008240/">Cirque Duluth</a> if
you're interested in getting involved with that!), and she's passionate about
the science behind our beautiful natural world as well as protecting,
preserving, and restoring wild spaces and habitats. Somehow she finds time to
climb too! One of my favorite things about Mikayla is how her entire face lights
up when she talks about something she is passionate about, so if you get the
chance to meet her or support one of her creative outlets, be watching for that
gleam in her eye! [caption id="attachment_516" align="alignnone"

<strong>What do you love about climbing/what does climbing mean to you?</strong>

For me, climbing is a way to connect to the natural world in a deeper way. Some
people enjoy going to a common, usually crowded crag and sending a bunch of hard
routes in a day. But I enjoy the journey of it allâ€¦the drive, the approach, the
environment, the wildlife, and the beauty one can find in more secluded climbing
areas. Along with that, the camaraderie Iâ€™ve formed with my partners is unlike
any other bond Iâ€™ve experienced. Itâ€™s wonderful!

<strong>What made you join/ get involved with VertiGals?:</strong>

<strong>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </strong>When Molly and Erin were first talking about
forming a womenâ€™s climb group, I thought it was a great idea and would be fun to
get involved with! When I first started climbing, I was intimidated by the
disproportionate number of males in comparison females, but I also didnâ€™t really
know how to make my way into the community of female climbers. Becoming involved
with VertiGals made me feel like I was a part of something that could lessen the
intimidation factor and welcome more lady crushers into our community! ***As
mentioned in the intro, Mikayla designed our logo shortly after we voted on our
name, the North Shore VertiGals. She presented logo options at our very first
board meeting which was pretty exciting! VertiGals has been made possible by so
many different women giving their time and talents to something they believe in,
and we are so grateful to each and every one! [caption id="attachment_517"

    >How are you hoping to grow as a climber or what skills are you hoping to
    develop?</strong
>

Lately Iâ€™ve been focusing on ice climbing (â€˜tis the season!) and trying to
develop my skills to the point where perhaps I could lead someday. Iâ€™m learning
to take rests when I happen upon good places for them, instead of when I need
them (both on the ice/rock and in life), and Iâ€™m hoping to increase my stamina
so I can hit harder and tackle bigger, more fun routes. Within the next year or
so, I hope to climb some tall ice with a long approach and a beautiful view. As
far as rock climbing goes, the trip to South Dakota this past summer really
opened my eyes up to what climbing can be, and I fell in love with itâ€¦again! I
would like to practice anchor building, gear placing, leading, and getting a
well-organized system down so that I can contribute my fair share to a
partnership when climbing bigger multipitch routes.

<strong
    >What would you like to see change in the Duluth/North Shore climbing
    community?</strong
>

<strong>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </strong>I would like to see the climbing tradition of
mentor-ship continue. Iâ€™ve been lucky enough to run into folks who have a wide
knowledge base and plenty experience in climbing and have taken me in as a
rookie climber and shaped me into the slightly more competent climber I am
today. I still have a ways to go, of course, but I wouldnâ€™t be where I am today
without those partners/mentors. It seems that today, it is more common for new
climbers to pair up and learn the ropes (pun partially intended) together.
Unfortunately, this has ended in quite a few injuries and casualties, when all
could have been avoided if there had been a more experienced mentor there to
check systems and correct any potentially fatal errors. [caption

    climbing (good or bad), or an experience you're proud of.</strong

<strong>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </strong>I went on a trip to South Dakota this past summer
with Bria Schurke, Erin Hammes, and Mireille Kidd. I led some mentally
challenging sport routes for the first time, learned about different systems for
both sport and trad anchors, and climbed multipitch routes for the first time.
It was the best experience of my climbing career thus far. The most powerful
moment of the trip for me was when I got to the top of Spire 4 of the Cathedral
Spires, via the Great Northwest Dihedral. I was second out of the four of us, so
as Bria was belaying me up, I was able to see her gear placements. Towards the
top, there were little to no cracks to place gear in, and there were no bolts,
except for at the anchorsâ€¦my hands are sweating typing thisâ€¦30 feet before the
anchors and summit, there was a downclimb (as shown in the photo), with a
wider-than-my-shoulders crevice to cross and hundreds of feet below. I crossed
it, got to the top, looked around, and started to tear upâ€¦I was amazed at what I
had just accomplished for the first time, empowered by what we had done as a
team, awe-stricken by the beautiful view, astounded at the mental game Bria was
able to crush with such grace, and slightly scared of how high up we were (we
were above the helicopters touring Mt. Rushmore). Iâ€™m lucky to have shared the
experience with these awesome ladies!!

    >Who/what are your current favorite inspirational
    climber/podcast/blog/resource?
</strong>

The Dirtbag Diaries Podcast (@dirtbag_diaries) is a great source of inspiration
for me because it not only features women climbers, but adventures of all sorts
from all sorts of people from all sorts of backgrounds. It inspires me to get up
and moving and try something new, even if it scares me, because the adventure is
worth it! Even if the adventure involves a little unplanned chaos, everyone
usually comes out the other end having learned something about themselves.
Angela Vanwiemeersch (@angela_vanwiemeersch) is another inspiration for me,
because her passion for ice climbing and getting after it is so motivating. Her
spirit of adventure and independence makes me want to venture out on my own,
whether it be for solo bike trips, canoe trips, or just traveling to a new place
and immersing myself in the climbing community there. Plus, she was a figure
skater growing up, just like me. ðŸ˜‰ Last but most certainly not least, women in
the Duluth climbing community all have so much to offer as far as inspiration
goes. There are ladies crushing it weekly, both in the gym and outdoors, going
on all sorts of adventures. Yâ€™all are amazing.
<p style="text-align: center">*****</p>
We couldn't agree more, the women of Duluth, including Mikayla are pretty
incredible and worth celebrating!
