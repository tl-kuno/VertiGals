    Starting the New Year off RIGHT with Janel Rieger. Janel is an absolute
    crusher calling the Twin Cities home. This gal knows how to WORK. She has
    some serious climbing sends under her belt and is hungry to learn more,
    conquer bigger walls, and make sure others are getting to come along for the
    ride! We are so excited for you to read all about our January 2021 WCW,
    Janel. Her interview was sprinkled with so many jewels of wisdom - sometimes
    I didn't even have a good question! On Read? Read on! (That was a belay
    joke...) Cheers!!

                an option for me. Once I found my place in climbing I realized
                how much I loved being outside. Climbing allows me to explore
                these spaces, discover new friends, and connect with myself and
                other people from around the world.</strong

                >I LOVE CRACK CLIMBING! Especially offwidth climbing! Crack
                climbing is what tied the knot for me in climbing. Once I found
                it I became obsessed with it. I would make up drills at tcb on
                the crack wall, circuits at Taylors, and I de-stress by making
                crack gloves at home. There is something incredibly beautiful
                about how each and every crack is different for everyone
                depending on their body. For me it's an ongoing love. I feel the
                most stoked when I’m wedged halfway in a crack trying to figure
                out how to move like a quarter inch up in an offwidth. There’s
                not a crack I don’t want to climb. Finger, offhands, offwidth,
                invert, overhang- I love them all.</strong

                season ice climbing and it has been phenomenal. At first, I was

                I ended up connecting with Scott Backes, a legendary alpinist.
                He was offering to give away his nomics and we connected about
                the intimidation of ice and alpine climbing for BIPOC women.
                Along with being equipped with nomics, he offered to help teach
                me skills that would aid me to make the transition from trad to
                alpine objectives. He also offered to do a session with a few of
                my bipoc female friends interested in ice climbing. He
                introduced me to some incredible local ice climbers that have
                brought me into their circle and made me feel welcome.</strong

                true. You can now find me ice climbing every chance I have and
                don’t worry I’ve even somehow managed to find some bomber hand

            Grabbing an FA in Mexico as a 1st generation Mexican-American woman
            climber, that'd be seriously cool. It's no secret that climbing, and
            the outdoor community at-large, has gains to make still on
            inclusivity. Any first-hand experience with racism or sexism the
            crags? <br /><br /><strong
                >Oh yes. I remember getting into climbing, it was incredibly
                exciting and then really frustrating. I wanted to start learning
                more about becoming an independent climber, meaning I could set
                up anchors, lead routes, and safely bring others along.
                Initially, I was met with a ton of male ego, talked down to,
                purposely excluded, and straight up feeling like I didn’t
                belong. It was disheartening, but eventually I met a few amazing
                fellow BIPOC climbers that became my climbing mentors and
                friends.</strong
            >
            <strong
                >Even as I progressed, I had partners gaslight me and talk down
                to me as a climber, saying things like “are you sure they said
                that because you’re a woman” and so on. </strong
            ><br /><strong
                >Recently, I was ice climbing and I had several white climbers
                talk at me when I brought up white privilege in the US and
                climbing. Rather than try to listen to some of the experiences I
                was trying to share as a brown girl and 1st gen American, I was
                interrupted, talked down to, and essentially mansplained what
                white privilege means. It was frustrating being I was the only
                POC at the moment. I felt so small and unwelcomed. At the end of
                it, we were able to come to a mutual understanding but this
                happens far too often to BIPOC people and it makes it hard to
                feel completely welcome. This, however, has fueled me to do the
                work I do within our climbing community and it’s made me even
                more passionate about climbing.</strong

                the thing, until we actually start to listen to the
                underrepresented community and let them become leaders in all
                aspects of it we are not there yet. A few things to highlight,
                geotagging became a big topic this year with a lot of people
                wanting to start getting outdoors more with COVID-19. There was
                a pushback from the outdoor community to stop geotagging and
                keep these places hidden. This kind of idea perpetuates that
                only certain people should be allowed in outdoor spaces. Those
                certain people tend to not include people of color. Often, being
                knowledgeable of how to navigate the outdoors was not a
                privilege we grew up with. At the end of the day, it's
                gatekeeping and elitism of public lands. Everyone, no matter
                their upbringing, should be allowed the chance to find and
                explore these areas. Instead of pushing an anti-geotagging
                movement, we, as an outdoor community should be pushing
                education on outdoor ethics and how to leave no trace</strong

                climbing have shaped a lot of how climbers act and treat others
                in our community. There is a lot of exclusiveness, negativity

                beautiful our community can be. That being said, there's still a
                lot we have to work on. For example, when I started looking for
                what gyms I wanted to be a part of, I started climbing at one of
                the smaller gyms locally. I was met with a lot of exclusive
                climbers, ego driven beta sprayers, and white girl clicks that
                didn't seem to have room for me to climb with them. I thought,
                maybe it was just me. I have a pretty loud personality and often
                am told I should quiet down or calm down by these other
                climbers. Then I talked with other BIPOC female climbers and
                they had similar experiences in these same climbing spots. They
                felt like outsiders and ended up finding themselves climbing
                alone. This made my heart hurt.

            Any wisdom for our readers on how to improve inclusivity and
            therefore diversity in climbing??

                >As a climbing community we have so many opportunities to do
                this and it begins with us, as individuals. A big portion of
                this is being open to climbing with people outside of your
                group. Being willing to bring a new person in, teach them some
                of the ropes, and introduce them to others they might connect
                with. Climbing is an intimidating sport. It's dangerous, it
                takes you to far away places, and it pushes you physically and
                emotionally. That's why mentorship is so vital to keep our
                spaces clean, safe, and for the future of developing this
                sport.</strong

                >Most of the women I’ve mentored didn’t think they would ever be
                leading trad or going on a climbing trip. Once they started,
                they became integral parts of our community, from buying state
                park passes, picking up trash, to becoming more aware and vocal
                of why we need to be conscious of climate change and preserving
                these public lands. This is incredibly important not only to
                climbing but for the future of these lands. Lastly, we need more
                access to education, we need to be highlighting what BIPOC
                climbers are doing, and continue to support climbing
                organizations dedicated to bringing more diversity to
                climbing.&nbsp;</strong

    SPEAKING OF HIGHLIGHTING AWESOME BIPOC CLIMBERS, you've been on some BIG
    WALLS! Where all at??

        >This Fall I started to focus on transition to big wall projects for
        Yosemite. I spent a large portion of my climbing time in North Conway,
        NH. I did the Prow, mordor wall, and then climbed in an area called
        cannon cliffs. One of my favorite routes was Moby Grape and well I
        absolutely adore all East coast climbing.</strong

                >IT WAS SO FREAKING INCREDIBLE! I got there early, it was 50
                degrees, so send temps. I had a triple rack of 00 to .75,
                doubles up to 2, and two sets of nuts. Then looked up at it and
                was in awe. There was something so beautiful about this climb
                and even this moment in my climbing for me. I definitely have
                those moments before a climb of am I ready for this, is this too
                much, and other nervous inner banter. This time, as soon as I
                looked at the line, I just knew I wanted more than anything to
                be climbing that. Like this climb was made for me. Plus, I had
                an incredibly supportive climbing partner with me that day and
                that makes a world of a difference.</strong

                >The money pitch started out with tiny fingers locks, a few hand
                jams, and a lot of delicate corner toe placements. It wasn’t
                until about a quarter to halfway up that I was able to fully
                commit to the stem and that was just fine. Once the stemming
                began it was all about fighting that endurance pump, trusting my
                finger locks, and smears. I truly loved it and despite the calf
                pump and some sacrificial blood from the finger locks I never
                stopped smiling. The happy send vibes lasted for months and it
                is everything it's hyped up to be.</strong
