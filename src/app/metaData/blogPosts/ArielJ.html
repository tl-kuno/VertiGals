                the life of me remember where!</strong
            ><br />When and where did you originally start climbing:
            <strong>2015 at Vertical Endeavors </strong><br />If you had a
            million dollars, the first big purchase you would make is:

            travel is unrestricted again, where do you hope to travel?<strong>

    'What's The Nandagikendan Seek to Learn Academy?', you may ask. (I had to
    google it, too, dear reader. Don't fret!) The Academy provides high school
    students the opportunity to learn and experience college life on the Fond du
    Lac Tribal and Community College campus. So cool!

                success, and I take on other projects as needed to support our
                students holistically. I see it as being able to hang out with
                students and help them in being prepared for whatever comes

            focus on as we continue in this Pandemic?<br /><br /><strong

                It's hard to bring three dogs to local trails/parks and keep
                them under control…especially being 20 weeks pregnant!</strong

            Right! Okay, so besides bringing LIFE into this world (CONGRATS!!),
            do you have another "Pandemic Project"? <br /><br /><strong

    Why do you spend your time climbing as opposed to other activities?
    <br /><strong
        >I enjoy climbing because it challenges you mentally as well as
        physically. Some days it feels like a dance up the wall, other days it
        feels more like moving a mountain.</strong

            You you experienced sexism, racism, homophobia, etc. in the outdoors
            community? What did you take away from that? <br /><strong
                >While I haven't experienced so much in outdoors communities, I
                have experienced when I was an intern at a local fishery (my
                bachelor's is focused in more of the fieldwork biology). I was
                questioned frequently on if I could handle lifting things or
                dissecting fish (to gather data for ongoing studies) due to
                being a female. The other intern and I were the first female
                interns for that branch, and we felt the need to prove we could
                do just as well as, if not better than, our male peers.</strong

            From that experience in your internship, or your experience from
            FDL, or honestly just life in general, what would you like to see
            groups like VertiGals do to be inclusive??<br /><strong
                >As of right now it would be difficult, but once things start
                opening up I think Vertigals could partner with other groups or
                with Vertical Endeavors (or other climbing areas) to host "open
                climb nights" or other public events to encourage people of all
                backgrounds to try climbing. It can be intimidating to see more
                experienced climbers rocking the wall (pun intended), but my
                experiences have usually been that those people are always more
                than excited to help newer climbers and encourage them to keep
                going. I've always found the rock climbing communities to be
                supportive and diverse, so I think we could just continue that
                positive vibe of building our community.</strong
