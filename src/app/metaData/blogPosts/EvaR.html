Meet <a href="http://www.instagram.com/eeeeva_r">Eva Robinson</a>, this weeks
WCW! Eva is one of our newer climbers, and we've loved watching her learn the
ropes and increase her knowledge, skills, and strength over this past year! Eva
is a graduate student in the Environmental Education program at UMD so it's not
surprising that she is passionate about both improving public education and
spending time outside. She loves hiking, backpacking, running, and yoga, and
she's also into water sports, such as water skiing, paddle boarding, and her
favorite, scuba-diving. After a full day she enjoys cooking and trying new
foods, especially when paired with a good wine or beer! Eva has been wonderful
to get to know, and we love building relationships and community through this
group!

<strong>What do you love about climbing/what does climbing mean to you?</strong>

Climbing feels like playing to me.  As adults, and myself in particular, we take
often take life so seriously that we forget to play.  When I’m climbing, I feel
like I’m 10 years old playing on the rocks while on a hike with my parents. I
also don’t think about much else when I’m climbing and I’m usually with another
person who’s company I greatly enjoying.  It’s such a good reminder that life is
better when we spend time with great people and just play!

<strong>What made you join/ get involved with VertiGals?:</strong>

My friend Megan told me about the group and since I had moved to Duluth pretty
recently, it seemed like a great way to meet more like-minded people.  I was
hooked after the first climb night I attended.  I don’t think I’ve ever felt
more welcomed into a new group of people than I have with VertiGals.  Even
though I don’t have a lot of climbing experience, I’ve never felt intimidated,
only inspired to climb more! [caption id="attachment_592" align="alignnone"

After meeting Erin at a climb night, and telling her that I had only climbed
outside twice, she invited me to climb with her the following Sunday at Shovel
Point. Snow flurries were predicted, I had just met Erin, and I had little
experience outside.  However, I decided it seemed like a great opportunity and
joined in on the adventure.  I was so nervous during my first climb, but Erin
was really encouraging and I felt so accomplished when I finally reached the
top. I’d had enough adrenaline for the day and spent the rest of the day
watching, talking, and enjoying the incredible views of the North Shore.  Even
though I only climbed once, it was a great way for me to push myself outside of
my comfort zone.

<strong>How did you get started climbing?</strong>

I started climbing in high school thorough an elective called Adventure
Education.  We learned how to climb on the school’s wall, took a field trip to
VE in Minneapolis, and climbed outside at Devil’s Lake.  Looking back, it was a
pretty phenomenal opportunity for exposure to new types of activity, especially
for a public high school.  Although I loved the class, I didn’t stick with it
and only started climbing again about a year ago after moving back to Duluth. My
husband and I are both pretty inexperienced climbers so we thought climbing
would be a good things for us to grow in and learn together. [caption

    >How are you hoping to grow as a climber or what skills are you hoping to
    develop?</strong
>

Climbing makes me really nervous. Some days when I’m in the gym I feel like I
can do anything and other days I feel like I might cry halfway up the wall. 
Mentally, I know I’m going to be ok but some days it takes a lot of internal
reminders to keep me going.  And sometimes, I just accept that it might not be
my day to push myself.  That balance of mental toughness and self-acceptance is
something I’m always trying to improve, both on and off of the wall.

welcomed and encouraged as she has! Do you have suggestions for making VertiGals
better? Send us message, we'd love to hear from you and are always trying to be
