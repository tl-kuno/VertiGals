    I started climbing in 2004 when I worked as a camp counselor for a YMCA camp
    in Connecticut. I had always liked climbing trees as a kid, so climbing
    rocks seemed like a fun thing to do. I spent my summers in Connecticut
    teaching kids to climb and getting in my first few multiple pitches. During
    the school year I went to UMD so started volunteering at the climbing wall
    there. Coincidentally, my older brother was getting into climb as well and
    also lived in Duluth. He was highly influential in showing me all the
    amazing places to climb around Duluth and up The Shore. One of my first
    outside climbs up The Shore was at Section 13, which really led me to fall
    in love with not only that spot but climbing on The Shore in general. This
    area is like a giant playground and I definitely have more exploring to do.

    I am a big fan of the Mystical Mountain Zone. It was the place that a pulled
    my first roof, which was a move I was really struggling with. It definitely
    helped me get over the mental block I had put on myself. It also has some
    fun hand jams to play on as well.

            A few years ago my brother Sam, friend Dan and I were climbing
            Birdland, a fun 600 foot climb in Red Rocks, near Las Vegas. The
            wall gets blasted by the sun most of the day, so it can be too hot
            to climb, especially for this Minnesotan. We set out late in the
            afternoon and had the climb to ourselves. About halfway up you are
            standing on a little ledge with nothing but flat rock and crack
            around you. The exposure was making me a little squirmy – but in a
            fun way. It was just at this time when the sun set and we clicked on
            our headlamps. This was my first time climbing in the darkness and I
            completely fell in love with it! All my squirmy feelings melted away
            and you only concern yourself with the rock your headlamp can show
            you. With the lights of Vegas showing in the distance we finished
            the climbing and packed up to rap down. Dan and Sam simo-rappelled
            down and then I followed the glow of their headlamps on my own.
            While waiting at the anchor for my turn, I was struck by the intense
            calm. I was experiencing a gentle breeze coming across my body, a
            blanket full of stars above me and 600 feet of darkness below me. It
            was an incredible experience – one that won’t be forgotten any time
            soon.

        <p><strong>So, you ever had a bad climbing experience??</strong></p>
        <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

        <p>
            On my first ever multi-pitch climb out in Connecticut, I was
            climbing with my good friend Mikey. We were both pretty fresh to
            multi-pitch but eager to get on the rock. On the second pitch of the
            climb we had to traverse around a large bulge in the rock and then
            were meant continue up a chimney to the to the third anchor. Mikey
            led and had hauled up the rope behind him. I broke down the anchor
            and precariously started my dance around the bulge. We were around
            200 feet off the ground, so there was a bit of exposure for someone
            who hadn’t done a lot of multi-pitch. Needless to say, I was a
            little nervous about the traverse. My little dance across the rock
            was successful but looking into the chimney gave me my real fright!
            The rope had not been tight on me the entire time, but the weight of
            the rope as well as rope drag had tricked me into thinking I was on
            belay! There was about 30 feet of rope hanging down in the chimney
            and looping back up to me. I squeaked out, perhaps the most, urgent
            “take” of my life! The rest of the pitch went off without a hitch
            but I learned my lesson with rope drag and good communication with
            your belayer that day, for sure!

<p class="has-text-align-right">
    I think the part of climbing that I enjoy the most is the puzzle, especially
    when climbing outside. I love how two people can approach a climbing in
    completely different ways and be successful. A move that may be easy for
    someone who is tall, makes me have to think creatively. There is always a
    way to solve the puzzle though.

<p class="has-text-align-left">
    I consider myself a bit of a jack of all trades, master of none, with all
    activities outside. I feel as though I could be a much better climber if I
    trained and practiced more but then I would have to let another activity go.
    Sometimes I think maybe I have too many outdoor interests, but I am never
    willing to give one up to improve my skills at another.

<p class="has-text-align-right">
    The last few years I have been leading sport climbs, which has been really
    fun. I would love to continue to practice this but ultimately, I would like
    to get into trad climbing more. It seems like this style of climbing has the
    potential to open up a lot more big walls in the form of multi-pitch.
