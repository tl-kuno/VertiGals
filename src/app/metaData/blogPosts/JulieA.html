<p>This weeks WCW Julie <a href="http://www.instagram.com/julieahlbrecht">@julieahlbrecht</a> is near and dear to my
    heart, as she is the first woman that ever took me climbing outside; even though I didn't know her very well and I
    was a total newbie she was still willing to take me climbing at Palisade Head. It was the first time I recognized
    the magic of climbing with and learning from women. Julie is a Registered Nurse and currently lives out in Tuscon
    Arizona, where she considers Mount Lemmon her new local crag. She loves to travel, hike, spend time with family, and
    is always up to hop on her bike. Julie was a staple in the North Shore climbing community while she lived here, and
    still comes back to climb for a bit every summer; she's got some great insights into our North Shore climbing
    community thanks to her extensive time climbing here. </p>

<p>Absolutely everything! Before climbing, I never had a sport I was interested in. I loved being outside, breaking a
    sweat, and traveling, but never had much direction with any of that until I began climbing. It’s emotional,
    physical, mental, beautiful, and comes equipped with some of the most wonderful folks out there. From the first
    moment I was immediately hooked and was able to sympathize with others addicted. It has also helped me make friends
    as an adult (which I think is just hard to do in general).</p>
<p><strong>What made you join/ get involved with VertiGals:</strong></p>

<p>I definitely missed the VertiGals train ☹(VertiGals started a few years after Julie left town)!! Early in my climbing
    I hated hearing “oo ladies climbing trips!” or anything that seemed to just boil me down to my double X chromosomes
    as a way to qualify for something. I usually spent all of my time climbing with friends, be it guys or girls and
    didn’t notice much of a difference. I just liked spending time with people I liked spending time with. It wasn’t
    until I started bouldering that climbing with girls seemed to really mean something more to me. Seeing a girl crank
    hard on something is so much more inspiring to me than seeing (even a shorter) guy do it. It makes me feel like I
    can do it too and motivates me off the ground.  Being able to share beta is also so key, and I feel like girls are
    more fun to verbally processes with too (generally). I feel like it can be weird to try and get into climbing if you
    don’t know anyone and it’s nice to have a good, safe, supportive environment and community to get you up and
    running.</p>[caption id="attachment_585" align="alignnone" width="636"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-585"

<p>If we’re talking Minnesota, PALISADE HEAD hands down! I’ve been to a good amount of climbing locations, but I still
    just love it. The approach is 5-30 steps, the view is incredible, the climbing is hard/beautiful/peaceful, the
    weather is exciting, and you can usually get away from people if that’s what you’re looking for. I just can’t talk
    about it enough. It’s probably where I have spent the most time climbing. I learned to set up anchors and fiddle
    with gear there…it’s just a wonderful place. I could go on for a long time.  </p>[caption id="attachment_582"

        North Shore climbing or the Duluth climbing community? What do you not miss or what would you improve now that
        you’ve experienced other climbing areas and communities?</strong></p>
<p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
</p>
<p>Miss: Even though I’m in the SW enjoying the plentiful pitches and different areas out here, I still try to come back
    at least once a year to Palisade Head. It is still the most breathtaking, peaceful, and motivating crag I have ever
    been to, maybe it’s the history, but she ain’t too bad to look at either. I also OF COURSE miss the people of the
    climbing community. These people have been the most patient, interesting, welcoming, and understanding folks I have
    ever met (and have put up with a significant amount of my tears).</p>
<p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
</p>
<p>Improve: I have seen a couple rappel-in areas that share space with regular recreative areas that have “don’t throw
    rocks” or “people climbing below” signs. Our rap-in areas could certainly use some of that action, and maybe adding
    in a “if you can’t say something nice, don’t say anything at all”. I think the most impressive thing I’ve been hit
    with was a watermelon rind from above.</p>
<p><strong>What would you like to see change in the Duluth/North Shore climbing community?</strong></p>
<p>
    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
</p>
<p>Just make it a little bigger? When I’m coming back through town the list of people to call seems to get shorter every
    year. People move. Duluth is a good launching point. Maybe you could super glue Kraig Decker to Duluth?</p>

<p>I had gone on a trip to the needles in SD. I went with a climbing partner and we stayed with my family in a cottage.
    Combining a family trip with a climbing trip was the most wholesome thing I have ever experienced, and I wanted that
    to be recreated in my life. My parents had started snow birding (heading south for the winter) and when they
    switched plans from Florida to Arizona, I decided to uproot everything and head down there. No regrets, there’s so
    much rock and so many tacos down here!</p>
<p><strong>What is the best part about where you live/climb now?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can climb year-round! It’s always sunny, low humidity (no achy joints). Even when it’s 110, you can roll up to
    the top of the mountain and enjoy some pitches in decent temps in the shade. I rarely consult weather apps now.
    There are also 2,000+ routes on the mountain. The climbing community is also very welcoming, plentiful, psyched, and
    crazy strong.</p>

<p><strong>Favorite inspirational climber/podcast/blog/resource and why?<br></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If I’m getting up early in the morning to go climbing, I have to watch “origins: the hulk”. It gets me all excited
    for the day. ‘For the love of climbing’ has been one of my favorite podcasts as of late exploring different ways
    climbing touches different aspects of life. I also enjoy reasoning out risk with “the sharp end” podcast. As far as
    inspirational climbers…I think I’d have to say I have been most inspired by my climbing partners throughout the
    years. There are just some people that make you cock your head to the side and say, “how’d you do that?!”</p>

<p>I’m always looking to improve my mental game. I have a good memory and as a nurse see a fair bit of messed up bodies.
    Put that together with getting hurt outside, and seeing people get hurt outside (which happened a lot last year),
    and I’m just not interested in much risk taking- which has limited my climbing considerably as of late. I’ve always
    struggled with my mental game, so if I could improve that I think my climbing would greatly benefit. It usually just
    takes a lot of getting outside for me to turn the corner into being good in my head again.</p>

<p>I had been climbing for almost 2 years and went on a trip to the Wind River Range in WY. I was so incredibly not
    prepared for how exhausted and scared I was going to be. I think I cried every day…almost all day.. and was probably
    the worlds worst wet blanket partner (I’m sorry). It’s probably my biggest shame in climbing. I left wondering if I
    even liked climbing anymore, if any of it was worth that kind of risk. Then after talking to some wonderful
    Duluthians they picked me back up and reminded me that stuff like that happens, not to be so hard on myself, etc.
    <strong>Whenever I think my sh*t don’t stink, I think about little Julie weeping all over the beautiful mountain
        ranges.</strong> It keeps me ever so humble.

<p><strong>What is something about your climbing history no one would ever guess?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<ol>
    <li>The double-edged sword part of having good temps year round is that it’s hard to stay motivated. There’s no real
        “off season” and my body gets tired.</li>
</ol>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. I used to hate bouldering with a searing passion. Now it makes up most of my climbing. I feel a slight shame over
    it, but mostly, it has made me a stronger climber.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3. If I try hard on any climb and it doesn’t work out, there is a 98% chance I will cry.</p>

<p>My brother had started climbing and set up a top rope on one of our family camping trips in Jay Cooke. From the first
    moment, I was hooked. I started climbing at VE just about every day and met many of my now friends on those hallowed
    walls. </p>
