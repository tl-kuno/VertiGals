<h4>Interview written and compiled by Stephanie Hall</h4>
This weeks WCW is a truly special woman in the Duluth community, not just within
the climbing community but also within the Duluth birthing community and
community of new mothers. Stacy Holden considers her first job to be a
homeschooling mama but she also is a yoga instructor who runs
<a href="https://www.womencirclingwomen.com/our-story/"
    >Women Circling Women:</a
>
a prenatal yoga circle where women are supported throughout their pregnancy and
create communities of support that last post-partum. Many of our climbing mamas
have participated in the circles throughout their pregnancies and speak so
highly of the community created in those circles, how important it was for their
pregnancy journey, and always mention what an amazing instructor and guide Stacy
was for them. Stacy and her partner Dustin have 4 kids, all home-schooled and
all climbers, but she still has time to garden, paddle, practice yoga, swim,
cliff jump, ski, hike, homestead, and spend time outside creating and exploring.
Stacy has years of insight into the Duluth climbing community, as well as
traveling to climbing crags throughout the US as a family, and guiding and
supporting her kids through their climbing journeys. The Holden family is well
known in the climbing community, and it is a joy to get to learn more about this
incredible force in our community!

    >How long have you been climbing? How has your relationship with climbing
    changed as you’ve had kids? How have you balanced your own climbing and your
    kids?  </b
>

I started climbing in 1995!  I found an awesome climbing partner out in Santa
Cruz who wanted a partner to belay him up big walls and go on adventures.  I was
hooked in no time. I had some amazing adventures out west with him (and later
with Dustin) in my 20’s. We took a break to have our kids and got swept up with
other adventures for awhile (paddling, camping, LIFE).  I was thrilled to get
back to it when the kids got stoked on it. I had a blast on those Friday night
women’s nights until the kids REALLY got into it. Then I was the queen belayer
for way too long, watching each of them excel while I stayed on the ground
(usually nursing!).  Now that they’re older, I’m happily back on the wall. My
favorite climbing times are when we all at the crag, boys are sending crazy hard
climbs, Dustin and I area plugging away on our own routes and the girls are
making quick work of our projects. My joke I say to the kids all the time is
that I’ve been at the same on sight level for 23 years!  I’m not any worse, and
I’m not any better. Just holding steady. [caption id="attachment_608"

<b>What do you love about climbing/what does climbing mean to you? </b>

I LOVE the movement!  I have no interest in getting crazy strong or sending hard
routes. I love the free and creative movement that is available to my body.  The
high steps, big reaches, long stemming legs… I love the fact that anyone can
climb and make it their own. l like that here’s not a specific way that all
bodies need to move.

><strong
    >that, why you think this is important, and what you think women can get out
    of learning </strong
><strong>from women teachers/mentors and learning alongside women? </strong>

YEARS ago I led high adventure wilderness trips for adolescents.  I really
enjoyed working with all the kids, but especially the young women.  It was fun
empowering them through wilderness exploration. Allowing them to see their
strength and find their passion through pushing past their limits and opening
their minds and hearts to something so much bigger than themselves.  But it
wasn’t until I became a Mom (at 30) out in Santa Cruz and found my first circle
of women that I really discovered the beauty and power of sitting with women. In
the last 17 years of parenting I’ve strived to help women connect with each
other in supportive ways, holding non-judgemental circles in hopes that women
feel supported and empowered rather than judged and torn down.  I’m constantly
blown away at the strength and power of women as individuals and also as a
whole. Every time I sit with women I hear myself, my partner and my kids
reflected in their stories and experiences. I know I’m a more caring and
compassionate human because of all the women in my life. As a woman we only know
what we as an individual know. As a circle we can draw from all the wisdom of
the women around us--all the experiences, the questions, the understanding, the
awareness.  Listening to and sitting with other women, I’m always pushed well
beyond my little world of understanding. My mind and world opens up each time I
have that opportunity. [caption id="attachment_media-41" align="alignnone"

    >Your kids are strong, competitive climbers, when did they start climbing?
    What were your hopes and fears for them as they began climbing, and what are
    your hopes and fears for them now?
</b>

We started climbing at a homeschool day in the Spring of 2010.  Coulter was
almost 9, Cedar almost 6, Savi 2 and Opal not on the scene. Dustin and I had
climbed years ago and we were psyched to have an activity that we could all do
together. We hoped to cultivate a love for the outdoors and a love for
adventure. It was also really important to us to raise kids who would be great
stewards of the Earth.  We’ve had some amazing climbing trips as a family all
over the country. We’re psyched that they’re all into
camping/climbing/adventuring and that we have always been able to enjoy each
other that way. We were also thrilled that they were hooked on a life time sport
and we were thankful that they found a way to keep their bodies strong and
healthy. The boys’ climbing has certainly entered a level far beyond what we
ever imagined.  At this point we hope that they can keep learning from their
successes and, more importantly, their struggles through their training,
competitions and outdoor sending.  And we hope that they never loose their love
of climbing. They’ve been training hard through all the seasons year after year.
Their goals are HUGE. Sometimes it seems that they loose perspective.  The girls
are over the competition scene to be sure. We hope they keep loving climbing for
the sake of climbing, so that we can continue going on trips and they can
continue finding the joy in the movement, the adventure and the community.

    >Share a story of an impactful climb or experience you've had related to
    climbing (good or bad), or an experience you're proud of.  </b

Probably my favorite climbing experience was Royal Arches in Yosemite. I decided
to climb it in my tennis shoes because my climbing shoes were being repaired
(and I must have been feeling pretty lofty about my climbing skills!).  We
certainly packed some adventure into that day as I had to climb the slab in
tapped toes trying to cram my bloody toes into old piton scars. Then came the
big pendulum at the top in slippery tennis shoes... The day culminated in
reaching the top as the sun was setting and then needing to get back down
without enough water, food, or head lamps.  After telling the story over the
years I’ve come to realize that it’s a typical big wall saga. But it felt HUGE
and scary and overwhelming at the time. Hands down, my favorite part of climbing
is going UP. I’ve never found a love for bouldering, always felt like it was
pointless in that you never get to go anywhere! I loved climbing higher and
higher.  To get up hours before dawn, to climb all day long further and further
from the valley floor, to watch the ground disappear in the distance and the
trees shrink, the rivers dwindle, the birds soaring past, the wind blowing
hard..that’s what I loved best. Hoping my kids will someday lead me back up some
of those big walls. That’s where my heart sang the loudest. [caption

    >What would you like to see change in the Duluth/North Shore climbing
    community? </b
> I’m psyched that VertiGals is here in Duluth. I love seeing women climbing
together, supporting each other, encouraging each other.  Maybe more of it?
Getting more women involved and more meet ups at the gyms and crags. It would be
fun to get more ages involved. That and then some chances to develop
relationships.  It’s fun to have the thing that brings everyone together, but
then really fun to sit and dig into who each of us is. Overlapping ages and life
experiences make for such rich relationships.

<b
    >Have you experienced sexism, racism, homophobia, etc in this or any other
    climbing community?
</b>

Probably the worst we’ve experienced was in the RRG when adults were pissed off
that a bunch of kids were at the crag.  That usually shifted once they got on
the wall and started crushing, but left us feeling pretty bummed.

<b>Favorite local crag and why you love it? </b>

Palisade, hands down. I love anything next to this Lake.  It such a gift to be
alongside it and above it and be in it’s ever changing face of wind, sun, fog,
mist…

<b>How did you get started climbing? </b>

In my early twenties I attended a slide show of a man having climbed all over
the West.  He was looking for a partner. I was so taken by the photographs of
the wild places and was always searching for adventure.  I jumped right in and
we had some marvelous trips to Yosemite, Joshua Tree, the Pinnacles, and other
crags out West.
