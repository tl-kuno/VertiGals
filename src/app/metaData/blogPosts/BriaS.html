    Bria Schurke was basically raised in the wild by her expedition parents and
    sled dogs. She then chose to keep living in the wild as a NOLS instructor.
    Now she's back in Duluth to climb, ski, mountain bike, and be an all around
    b--a-- as a P.A. (physician's assistant) in Emergency Medicine. We caught up
    with her as she was returning from a mountain bike session on the new
    Jackpot trail in Lutsen. Read to learn more about her thoughts on climbing,
    COVID, and community....

            My favorite “style” of climbing is: <br /><br /><strong>
                Trad Alpine Climbing. In fact, the last opportunity I had to
                travel I went to the Wind River Mountain Range in Wyoming to do
                some alpine climbing. I went with my friend Karina. The Winds
                are a long, narrow span of granite cliffs that are really the
                closest place we have to this type of amazing alpine climbing.
                It was awesome going with another female, too! We went at our
                own pace, which honestly was a pretty intense pace! We had
                really nice weather the whole time, so we constantly found
                ourselves pushing deeper and deeper into the range! Each day we
                climbed in remote and beautiful areas, and just went for it
                every day! We hit a good flow. It reminded me that we have some
                really tough women in Minnesota. Minnesota may not have
                mountains, but I think we have a lot of women that are hungry
                for the real adventure climbing that mountain ranges
                offer.</strong

            A change in the Duluth/North Shore climbing community I would like
            to see is: <br /><strong
                >I would love to see a climbing gym (VE or otherwise) built in
                West Duluth, that was an inclusive and community centric space
                that both novices and experts alike to build community and build
                their climbing skills; a space where people of all ages,
                backgrounds, and abilities felt excited and welcome to be a part
                of. It'd also be great to see our Duluth community grow so that
                mentorship and menteeship can flourish. The lack of a mentor can
                be a big barrier for people to get into climbing and mountain
                adventure more broadly. We need to make sure people can safely
                get to that next level of adventure, if they want it!</strong

    When travel is unrestricted again, I hope to go to: <br /><strong
        >The Bugaboos in Canada. I have never been here but I have a close
        friend to Spokane, so we plan on going into the Bugaboos together at
        some point. The Bugaboos are known for being the "mecca" of adventure
        climbing in the Northwest. It's a stunning area. We don't have any
        specific routes planned - in fact I kind of love just getting into the
        wilderness with an open agenda. Just to feel strong, badass, and have
        all the Type 1 fun we can!</strong

            NOLS, or the National Outdoor Leadership School is a non-profit
            outdoor education program that teaches folks how to survive outside.
            You were a NOLS instructor. Tell me how you got into that:
            <br /><br /><strong
                >My dad is a fairly well-known adventurer and expedition leader.
                So, I grew up in a unique family that had adventure and extreme
                wilderness as a mainstay - I went to the North Pole when I was
                seven years old and I had been in Siberia eight times before I
                graduated from high school. I knew of NOLS growing up. After
                college I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my life, but I
                knew I wanted to spend my days outside, so I took an instructor
                course. I am really lucky to have had the opportunity to work at
                NOLS. It's not a well-paying job, but I could choose to be a
                wanderer, living out of my car with a low income in my 20s
                because I had a great support network to fall back on. I
                recognize this is a privilege that many who are interested in
                being outdoor leaders are not privy to.</strong

            NOLS not only set you up well for your favorite style of climbing,
            but also provided you some other benefits too, right?
            <strong
                >Yes! I'm so grateful for my time with NOLS. I have some
                lifelong friends from that. These are fun friends to have. I
                spent multiple season big wall climbing and highlining in
                Yosemite and Patagonia with NOLS colleagues. (My proudest climb
                was doing the Northwest Face of Half Dome in a day, a 22 pitch,
                Grade VI, 2200 ft big wall.). One time I got an e-mail from a
                guy I knew from NOLS a bunch of us were copied and he asked if
                anyone was interested in a canoe trip through Mongolia. I was
                the only one to respond yes! We spent three months canoeing
                across Mongolia, Eastern Russia, and Siberia. I flew to Mongolia
                from Somalia with a winter tent, winter jacket, life jacket, and
                canoe paddle. (I was working at a maternity ward in Somalia
                prior to my Siberia expedition). I looked pretty funny walking
                through this African airport with all that gear. The canoe trip
                was actually uneventful - everything went right!</strong

    You are a ER Physician Assistant - COVID must be pretty challenging for you!
    <br /><strong
        >Yes, COVID is definitely in here in Duluth. I'm happy to see people
        take it seriously and being careful. Especially as younger people, I
        think we have a responsibility to heed the call to social distance. We
        need that social connection and we can do it safely.</strong

            2020 has been a wild year, a big thing I have chosen to focus on
            during this year is:<br /><br /><strong
                >Being a better medical provider. This is a very stressful time
                for many people, which often manifests in physical symptoms. A
                big impact of COVID - besides being infected with the disease
                itself, of course - is the mental health aspect. People are
                destabilized with all of these huge lifestyle changes that COVID
                requires. I've seen patients that are manifesting their anxiety
                as chest pain because these are such trying times. One of our
                basic needs is human contact. The impact of loneliness is
                shocking. I am working on being more patient and kind. There's a
                healthy and appropriate way to connect with others and be
                outdoors responsibly.</strong

    Because of the pandemic, I am spending a lot of my free-time doing:
    <br /><strong
        >I'm from Ely and so I'm quite familiar with the Boundary Waters. The
        lake I live on is half in the designated wilderness area, but the BWCA
        is big. I am spending my time exploring new lakes in the BWCA. Even
        though I grew up here, I have grown to appreciate it a lot more and
        really understand how unique of a wilderness area it is and how lucky we
        are as northern Minnesotan's to have such a special place as our
        backyard playground. It is so important that we actively protect it for
        future generations.</strong

            Given your unique perspective from NOLS to ER Medicine, do you have
            a "call to action" for climbers, specifically?
            <strong
                >When we were in the Winds, we saw a lot of climbing groups that
                were leaving trash, camping directly on the trail, and violating
                Leave No Trace. I would love to see personal accountability and
                community accountability for our wild areas. If we demand access
                to these gorgeous outdoor spaces, let's demonstrate that we are
                worthy of it. Part of Leaving No Trace is having good risk
                management skills so we can avoid needless rescue situations.
                This circles back to my hope for our community to continue to be
                great mentors for each other and willing learners. I am always
                open to teaching alpine climbing and rescue skills and back
                country navigation/living skills. I think it's important to "do
                the outdoors in good style" and be proud of it. This is
                especially empowering for women.</strong
