                A story about how the North Shore VertiGals came to be.

                We waited under an expansive blue sky at a rickety gate to enter
                Hueco Tanks State Park, the legendary bouldering destination
                outside El Paso, Texas. We entertained ourselves with yoga and
                with a dangerous variation of catch with heavy rocks (builds
                finger strength, the boys said!), in the middle of the deserted
                road. Finally, we were allowed into the park. We started
                climbing as the sky turned red, and the pink syenite boulders
                reflected the sky.

            <p className="blog-copy">
                I had been nervous about the trip. My best friend Erin and I
                were invited by two friends, prominent climbers in our
                community. I felt privileged to be there. It was an opportunity
                to learn from the best. But I was worried that I would hold the
                others back, or wouldn't be able to climb what everyone else
                wanted to climb. I hadn't been bouldering for long. The guys
                climbed harder than I did to start, and I had recently injured
                my rotator cuff. It healed, but I hadn't had time to train for
                the trip. I had lowered my expectations for the trip. I didn't
                want to get frustrated.

            <p className="blog-copy">
                At Hueco Tanks, Erin and I fell in love with bouldering. We
                bruised our legs on knee bars and bat hung on horizontal roofs.
                We did yoga in the sun on hot bedrock. I stubbornly tried a
                single move one hundred times before I got it, with only a few
                tears in the process. When rain came, we hid in a cave and
                played on the classic Baby Martini until the sun returned. We
                admired the ability, the try-hard and the endless enthusiasm of
                our new friend Julie, who we met there. Erin sent the awkward
                Hourglass with a healthy 10-armed spot and came down with the
                biggest grin I've ever seen.

                And at the end of each day, we gathered with Dos Equis beers
                around the long table in the house at Hueco Rock Ranch and
                talked about bouldering, of course.
            </p>
            <p className="blog-copy">
                But when Erin and I thought about our community back in Duluth,
                we wondered where all the women were. At our home gym, seeing
                another woman, much less a group of them, in the bouldering area
                was rare.
            </p>
            <h2 className="blog-emphasis">
                Why isn't there a women's climbing group in Duluth? Erin
                wondered.

                Bouldering with the guys was fun, but could be frustrating.
                Their beta didn't help my short curvy body, but made me question
                my instincts and skills when they sprayed it anyway. After all,
                they had years more experience than me. When I tried hard, they
                helpfully told me they <em>knew</em>I could do it. But when I
                couldn't, or didn't because it was just a little too scary for
                me, I felt worse for failing their expectations.

                Erin said instead: You can do it; but if you don't want to, that
                is totally ok too.

                We mulled over the idea, and back home, we decided a women's
                climbing group should exist. We created a Facebook group for
                women climbers in the area, and started talking about it to
                anyone who would listen. For the first group climb, 15 women
                showed up. A year and a half later, over 130 climbers are
                involved in the group, now officially the North Shore VertiGals.

            <h2 className="blog-emphasis">
                Clearly, our community needed this.
            </h2>
            <p className="blog-copy">
                As our group was forming, we weren't alone. Women across the
                globe were coming together. Groups like Flash Foxy, Girls Who
                Climb, and Alpenglow Collective created forums, hosted climbing
                gatherings, and connected thousands of female climbers. And
                outside the climbing community, thousands of people around the
                world marched, demanding equality for all women.

                The VertiGals has brought all kinds of women together to climb,
                share beta, share meals, do yoga, have fun, and support one
                another. The VertiGals are each women who bring something
                different, valuable, and inspiring to our group. VertiGals
                events mean talking for hours about empowering women to advance
                their skills, increasing access for people of all backgrounds,
                and improving our local crags.

                Climbing with the VertiGals, I have learned that I do not need
                to lower my expectations in order to have fun. I just need to
                climb my own projects instead of someone else's.

            <p className="blog-copy">
                And as for feeling privileged to tag along on a climbing trip
                with some good climber dudes; that's just silly. All I need is a
                bouldering pad and some try-hard, and I can climb whatever,
                wherever, and with whomever I want. I belong at the crag just as
                much as any other climber there, regardless of my gender or if
                I'm working on a V0 or a V15. My privilege lies in the fact that
                I am an able-bodied person with the means to climb at all and
                that I have found supportive climbing partners and friends of
                all kinds in my community who inspire and help me grow.

            <p className="blog-copy">
                In March, a year after the VertiGal's first meeting, a group of
                us traveled together to another legendary bouldering
                destination, Bishop, California, for the FlashFoxy annual
                women's climbing festival. At the festival, climbing with dozens
                of strangers; women of different skills, ages, backgrounds, and
                colors; I couldn't help but notice feelings of support, instant
                mutual trust, friendship among climbers. And the feeling was
                really good. I took home a commitment to keep climbing with more
                women, more often.
