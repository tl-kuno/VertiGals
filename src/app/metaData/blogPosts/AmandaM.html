>has the personality that just thrives in outdoor spaces; she's fallen in love
with climbing, paddling, yoga, trail running, exploring, and backyard chickens.
She's got a degree in environmental education, she's developing a business
teaching nature-based yoga to kids (so cool!!!), and she's a sea kayak guide.
Amanda came to Duluth to attend UMD, and frequently returns to the area, but is
currently living in Savannah, GA. I first met Amanda when she was one of the
amazing students running the Women on the Wall program at UMD through RSOP (its
open to the public and will be resuming in the fall semester<strong

>This was personally my first experience with a space created specifically for
womxn, and it was such a mind-opening and positive experience, kudos to RSOP for
creating this space! Amanda was a great instructor; kind, welcoming and
knowledgable, so I know all who have the chance to have her as a guide,
instructor, or mentor are lucky to learn from her. My favorite tidbit about her?

<b>Where are you living now? Where is your new local crag? </b>

I am currently living in Savannah, GA (and have a guest room that y’all are
welcome to use!) local crag… unfortunately the rock climbing is limited in the
Savannah area, <span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial"
    >thankful to have the Savannah Climbing Coop in town, though bouldering is
    just not my jam, trust me I have tried so many times to like it... I do go
    when I am feeling real needy for some chalk dust and traversing action and
    it gets me through. </span
>

<b>What is the best part about where you live/climb now? </b>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial"
    >The amount of nature! The coast of Georgia is one of the most beautiful
    areas int the south, so many places to paddle and explore, the ecological
    diversity is astounding! </span

<b>What do you love about climbing?</b>

I love the very meditative flow of climbing, you must be in the moment and
mindful, you can’t be thinking about the past or the future, you must stay in
the present moment to succeed. &nbsp;

<b
    >What do you miss about North Shore climbing or the Duluth climbing
    community? </b
>

I miss being a part of the community so much! The friendly faces and
friendships, being able to go to the climbing gym for hours and climb and chat
and enjoy the company.  I miss the ability to go climbing in general, having a
gym close by,  the Lake, the rock... I miss it all!

<b
    >Share a story of an impactful climb or experience you've had related to
    climbing (good or bad), or an experience you're proud of.</b
>

Climbing literally changed the trajectory of my life, when I came to UMD as a
freshmen, I attended a freshmen trip rock climbing up the north shore of Lake
Superior, I had never climbed a day before in my life. I fell in love with the
sport, the climbing community welcomed me in with open arms and I found many
friends and  mentors who helped me find my path to graduate with a degree in
outdoor education, I now am beginning a grad school program in clinical social
work and plan to work in wilderness therapy. I am so thankful for that first
climbing trip and every climbing trip that came after, they each taught me many
lessons, and brought me closer to friends and mentors, as well as helping me to
connect with the natural world in Minnesota and beyond.

<b
    >How are you hoping to grow as a climber or what skills are you hoping to
    develop: </b
>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial"
    >Hoping to keep my strength up and when I am able to be back near a climbing
    gym / local crag that the transition back wont be too painful! I’m already
    cringing thinking about my future self's sore muscles and finger pads.</span

<b>Advice for the North Shore Climbing Community?</b>

I would say that I would keep investing in the climbing community, find ways to
give back, help those who may be held back from climbing for various reasons
find a way to climb and be a part of the community!

Just a quick note to say the frequency of WCW posts will be decreasing to every
other week, not from lack of amazing womxn to interview, but due to time
constraints. That said, if you've got suggestions for who should be featured
leave a comment, send a message, or tell us in person! We love hearing about
womxn who inspire you! &nbsp;
