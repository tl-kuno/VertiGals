    It’s April already (HUH?!) and that means shoulder season is squarely upon
    us here in the North... As we transition from winter to summer, you might be
    thinking about all your gear needs. We are, too! So this month we are
    featuring local Gear Guru Brooke Wetmore! Brooke is the Co-Founder of Great
    Lakes Gear Exchange who, when she's not being a bada$$ entrepreneur and
    business owner, you can find canoeing, biking, birding, and skiing! Read
    more to learn about our #WCW Brooke and her rad business.

                >A few summers ago I was invited to paddle 230 miles of the
                Colorado River through the Grand Canyon. I spent much of my time
                the summer before in my kayak, honing and getting my paddling
                abilities in shape to prepare myself for the big, high volume
                western river (a different experience than the low volume, rocky
                creeks of our area). The biggest rapid on the river is called
                Lava Falls. From the moment I agreed to go on the trip it
                started occupying a corner of my mind.

                >As the trip approached I started watching youtube videos of
                others running the rapid. When we arrived in Flagstaff to prep
                for the trip prior to heading up to the put-in, conversation
                about Lava Falls began. About half of our crew had paddled the
                river before (and had done the rapid), the other half of us were
                newbies. We had about 2 weeks of paddling before we got to the
                rapid, hardly a day went by that Lava Falls wasn't discussed by
                the crew - what were the lines, what did the features look like,
                what had past experiences been, etc. We finally made it to the
                top of the rapid where I spent close to half an hour just
                looking at the few 100 feet of river stretched out before me. As
                my fellow paddlers began loading in their boats I figured I was
                as ready as I would ever be. I followed my best friend into the
                drop, it was over in a flash. I followed the exact line I
                intended to and (bonus) stayed up right the whole time!</strong

                time of experiencing overt sexism until I was working in the

                by the perpetrator (whenever I was unloading a trailer full of
                kayaks in a public parking lot (which was literally my job)

                clerk at the gas station for their opinion about paddling
                conditions on the lake when I had made a call that conditions

                with a big crew, and one of the other women suggested we break
                off and do a ladies paddle. I again didn't think too much of it,
                thought it was "cute." But when we were paddling and encouraging
                each other, it was a completely different experience. I felt
