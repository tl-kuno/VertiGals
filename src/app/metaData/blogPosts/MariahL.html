<h5>Interview written and compiled by Stephanie Hall</h5>
Meet our newest board member and this week's WCW, Mariah Lyscio! Mariah is a
strong climber who has been a regular at our climb nights, yoga for climbers,
and potlucks, and we are so excited she has decided to get more involved with
the planning and organizing aspect of the group. Mariah has been climbing since
2012 when she and her then-boyfriend-now-husband got hooked after walking by the
wall at CSS every day while they were students. But as much as she loves
climbing her biggest passion in life is dance; she's been dancing for 24 years
competitively, professionally, and recreationally- she even spent 3 years
dancing as a MN Vikings Cheerleader after college! Now that they've settled down
in Duluth she loves to spend time with her husband Tom and black lab Luna,
whether its on a hike, a run on the Lakewalk or exploring the shore to admire
the beauty of Lake Superior. She also loves to travel, eat all of Duluth's
delicious food, and enjoys being outside in the sunshine (she admits she's not a
winter person and is ready for spring!). Mariah works as a program coordinator
at a local group home, and she recently started route-setting at VE-Duluth.
Watch for her fun boulder problems, and say hi to her at our next climb night!

    >What do you love about climbing/what does climbing mean to you?:</strong
>

I love that climbing can be like a dance. The routes that have intricate
footwork and flow well, make it seem like you’re ‘dancing on the wall.’ I have
also recently enjoyed setting routes at the gym! It’s fun to come up with
boulder problems, and different ways to use holds!

<strong>How did you get started climbing?</strong>

I started climbing because my (now) husband peaked an interest while we were in
college. He quickly became obsessed, and brought me along for the ride. (I was
also trying to impress him a little bit ;) ) We dove in quickly with climbing
trips with Outdoor Pursuit and entering climbing competitions in the area. I
even won the Women's Intermediate division in my first comp! [caption

<strong>What made you join/ get involved with VertiGals?</strong>

I got involved with VertiGals because it was an opportunity for me to be
involved in the local climbing community and be part of something great in
Duluth. I love how accepting the group is with new comers- seasoned climbers, or
brand new ones!

<strong>Favorite local crag and why you love it?:</strong>

I haven’t had many experiences of climbing outside YET, but I loved Shovel
Point! I enjoyed repelling down the cliff side and then getting to climb back up
over the great Gitchi Gummi. [caption id="attachment_678" align="alignnone"

    >How are you hoping to grow as a climber or what skills are you hoping to
    develop?</strong

I’m hoping to become more comfortable climbing outside, including setting top
anchors and route reading.

<strong>Tell us about one of your memorable climbing experiences.</strong>

This wasn’t necessarily bad, BUT one summer day a few years ago, my husband and
I were climbing at Red Wing. The weather started out sunny and warm. However, it
took a turn for the worst. Out of no where, dark clouds came rolling in and
robbed us of a successful climbing trip. Tom wanted to get one more climb in
before the rain, and that he did. We quickly packed up all of our gear
(haphazardly) and booked it down to our car JUST before a flash flood and hail.
We took refuge in a local restaurant that happened to have a tremendous brunch
buffet. That trip is definitely one for the books! [caption id="attachment_675"

    >How do you get in shape/stay in shape for climbing? Do you do any specific
    training or workouts? Do you go to the gym with specific goals or just climb
    whatever is free?</strong

<span lang="EN"
    >Typically, I don't specifically workout for climbing. I enjoy running
    outside (trails or road) and have recently become interested in CrossFit!
    When I'm at the gym though, I often climb whatever is free. However, I have
    been trying to get over the 5.10 hump so I find myself working on routes
    that would help with that. Warming up a lot on 5.8s and 9s before working on
    a harder route. I want to get better at those crimps!</span
