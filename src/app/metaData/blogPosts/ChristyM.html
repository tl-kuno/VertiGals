    Introducing one of the early-days VertiGals, Christy Meredith! Christy is a
    fantastic climber and scientist who lived in Duluth for 3 years before she
    moved to Las Cruces, New Mexico to pursue a position as a Project Manager at
    the Jornada Long-term Ecological Research Program. While here she was a
    Postdoc at the EPA and always up to climb outside and organized a few great
    women climbing outings. We miss the enthusiasm and joy she brought to the
    group but are excited to hear what she's been up to since she moved away (it
    rhymes with rad!). She's been climbing for 16 years now but it's not her
    only passion; she loves to get out backpacking, mountain biking, backcountry
    skiing, traveling, she's learning to play the mandolin, and hopefully
    combining her love of sampling local micro-breweries with her interest in
    making new friends!&nbsp;

    The mountains are very rugged and wild. I am becoming a multi-pitch trad
    climber, whereas I mostly did sport climbing before. It is fun and
    challenging to develop new skills. My main climbing partner is Marta Reece.
    She started climbing in her 50’s. She is now 67, and has probably climbed
    more routes here than anyone. She is somewhat of a local celebrity, and it
    has been a great opportunity to learn from her.

    I especially miss the beautiful views climbing over Lake Superior. Also, we
    do not have a climbing gym here like in Duluth. The climbing gym helped me
    to stay in shape, and I loved the social aspect of it. Finally, I just
    started ice climbing before I left Duluth, and I definitely miss that as
    well. I really think that the area around Duluth has some of the best ice
    climbing in the nation.It is amazing that the City of Duluth made the ice
    climbing area of Casket Quarry into a city park. Most of all, I miss the
    sense of community and recognition of the importance of outdoor and wild
    places for all socioeconomic groups, which was encouraged by the local
    officials and people in Duluth.

    I do not really have anything negative to say about the climbing community
    in Duluth. I was involved in VertiGals and the Duluth Climbing Coalition.
    Good people are involved in both of those groups. Both groups work towards
    providing climbing opportunities for all socioeconomic groups and genders in
    Duluth. It was surprising to me that there is not more of an outdoor
    climbing community in Duluth, as most people just go to the gym. It is not
    necessarily a negative thing, but it would have been nice to have more
    people involved in the outdoor climbing community as long as there was
    enough crag space!

<p><strong>What do you love about climbing? </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
    I love many aspects of climbing. What really got me hooked was this
    meditative state I get in sometimes when I am climbing. I don’t think about
    anything else, and my troubles slip away. I also love visiting beautiful
    places and hanging out with interesting people. Finally, being a type A
    person in the field of academia, I often feel I never have any tangible
    accomplishments. But when I go climbing, I can set out to work on a climbing
    project or have the goal of climbing a particular mountain. And it feels
    really good to accomplish a climbing goal.

    Right now, I am learning to be a better trad climber, including how to set
    better anchors, to climb using a two-rope system, and to place gear. I hope
    to continue developing these skills in order to become a more well-rounded
    climber.

    I think one of the most memorable experiences was when my friend Stacey and
    I did a 3-pitch hugely run-out climb at City of Rocks Idaho called Dikes of
    Gastonia. It was supposed to be easy, but there were no bolts and the entire
    climb involved belaying off horns and using horns for protection. It was
    much harder than I thought, and the lichen made it very slippery.When I got
    to the top, I had 2 feet of rope left. That climb was definitely a rush!

    I have climbed in many states, including Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois,
    Maryland, Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, New Mexico, Arizona, and Michigan I also
    love canyoneering as much as climbing. You get to see some beautiful places
    that most people don’t get to see, and use many skills including bouldering,
    rapelling, rope management, teamwork, and problem solving.

    It's so great to hear about the adventures Christy has been having, and how
    much she is always growing and learning as a climber. Once a VertiGal,
    always a VertiGal!
