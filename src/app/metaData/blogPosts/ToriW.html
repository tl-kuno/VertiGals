                >I went to Red Rocks with my climbing partner Sam Erickson. We
                were having a solid trip - we climbed a bunch and had a lot of
                fun. On our last day, we were just doing some sport climbs when
                I got a text on my phone. My credit card had been flagged for
                suspicious activity. I knew my wallet was in the rental car and
                Sam and I both thought someone had pulled a smash-and-grab on
                the rental car which we of course did not buy the extra
                insurance on. We were flying home on the red eye flight that
                night, so we wrapped up climbing for the day and hustled back to
                the car to find out what the damage was. When we got back to the
                car everything was totally fine. No smashed windows, no doors
                ajar, nothing. We couldn't figure out what had happened. I
                ripped open the glove compartment to find my wallet and my purse
                right where I had left them. I opened my wallet and found all my
                credit cards missing. I called and cancelled all my cards and
                ordered new ones and puzzled over how this happened. Then it
                dawned on me. When we were getting ready for climbing that
                morning we were approached by an older couple asking questions
                about our gear and what we were climbing. They asked us where we
                were from and we replied that we were from Minnesota. They
                excitedly replied they were from Canada and we were lulled into
                a false sense of security. We continued to talk and at one point
                were joined by another couple who were with the original people
                we were talking to, but had much less to say. They left shortly
                after and we headed out to the climbs; not thinking anything of
                our encounter at the time. Looking back we are pretty sure that
                we got straight up hustled. They did a great job keeping our
                attention on the distant cliffs and not to the open doors of our
                car directly behind us. We should have known better; they didn’t
                even have an accent. So, close your car doors, climb with your
                wallets, and don't let the “Canadians” fool ya!</strong

        >My first multi pitch climb, Big Bad Wolf in Red Rocks. BBW is a 4-pitch
        sport route that goes at 5.9. This was my first time climbing out west,
        first multi pitch, so I was a little nervous. I was climbing well,
        nearing the top of the first pitch when I got to a move that not only
        definitely required a dynamic move, but I was about 12-15 feet above my
        last bolt. I tried to figure out a way to do the move static, but
        couldn’t and couldn’t bring myself to go for it. I ended up downclimbing
        to the bolt and getting lowered. That experience pushed me to get
        stronger at leading and get a better leader head. Between this and
        having my last day of climbing cut short in Red Rock I have some
        unfinished business that will definitely bring me back to Red
        Rock!</strong

                festival and it was the last climb of the day. As I was getting
                lowered I had a shelf of ice come down on top of me. I had a
                good sized goose egg on my head and a few cuts on my face. As
                the night progressed I started to have some concussion symptoms,
                so I had to call it an early night and get some good rest the
                week after. Overall I was really lucky and I was out climbing
                the next day at Shovel Point!</strong

        been mountain biking and climbing. I also got a puppy in late May! Her
        name is Koda and she's a rescue pup - no clue about her breed. We've
        been together a few weeks and she's gone hiking, canoeing, camping, and
