This weeks WCW comes to you in the form of an essay by Mari Hardel. Mari is a
strong and creative route setter, a passionate cross country skier, a huge fan
of winter, and has the most joyful smile around. You won't find her ice climbing
because it would take time away skiing, but you will find her climbing outside
whenever she gets a chance the rest of the year. She is currently working as a
Noxious Weed Specialist at the Minnesota Department of Agriculture. Find her on
instagram at @mari.anna.38 and in the gym find her routes with the setter name
Mari.

Mari's Climbing Journey: I tried to pick up climbing as a hobby when I was 18
and a freshman in college. My room mate and I spent a few Friday nights at the
climbing wall and loved traversing back and forth, but when I climbed to the
very top of the wall I only felt my hands getting sweaty and thought about how
high above the ground I was. So I quit. Five years later I met a guy (now my
husband, Tyler) and after knowing each other for a few months we decided that we
would spend the summer working and living together in Colorado. He was in love
with climbing and I knew that if I wanted things between us to work that summer
I should at least become a casual climber. I practiced at VE a couple of times
over the winter and was frustrated, thought I was certainly too short to climb,
and was still afraid of how high above the ground I was.

So we moved to Colorado for the summer, and for the next two summers. I learned
to climb outside and I kept trying. We lived out of our car for months at a time
(we still drive around with a mattress in the back most of the time) and spent
most of our weekends climbing, fishing, and climbing some more. After ticking
off dozens of sport climbs, a few multi-pitch routes, and finding the BEST
secret camping spots I started to feel less frustration, realized that with
better technique I was never too short, and thought a little less about how high
above the ground I was. During those few years of my life I fell really in love
with the person I was becoming, fell in love with Tyler, fell in love with
living outside, and fell in love with climbing (and winter, too).

What I love about climbing is that it is NOT something that comes easily to me.
It’s something that I have had to work hard at and I still work hard at. I
learned to keep trying even when I was nervous, even when I thought I couldn’t
do it. I learned that even though I’m not tall and lanky, even though I was
always afraid of heights, even though it took me 23 years to do my first
pull-up, I can be a climber.

Nobody forced me or tricked me to get into climbing. I think despite being
afraid of heights and letting my frustration guide my climbing experience in the
beginning I was always really intrigued by the idea of using my own strength,
balance, and head to climb to the top of a wall. I always really enjoyed
spending time outside and observing details about the world around me, and
climbing really fits into that. I’m still working on climbing more challenging
routes and becoming a stronger lead climber, and I’m excited that the learning
with climbing never ends.  It never gets old to flash a new route, hike into a
new crag, or push the limits of what I thought I could do and to find success.
This winter I’ll be out on the ski trails a lot training for cross country ski
races, but I’ll be in the gym setting routes and climbing some, too! &nbsp; Mari
will be route setting for the Duluth Climber Coalition comp being held January
12th! Be sure to enter, it is sure to be a fun day!
