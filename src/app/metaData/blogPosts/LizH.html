    Meet our November WCW Liz! Liz hails from 'Bama originally but calls the
    Twin Cities home now. She works as a microbiologist by day, and a climbing
    CRUSHER by night and weekend. Liz [and October WCW Rachelle] got the send of
    Oz – (AKA The Road To Emerald City) at Palisade Head this fall, and we knew
    we needed to interview her immediately. When not climbing, she likes to
    bike, read, travel, and garden. Read on to learn about her experience with
    subtle sexism, her send of a Palisade classic, and why you should absolutely
    go get on a project like Oz!

            Have you ever experienced sexism in the outdoors community?<br /><strong
                >Ah, I think we all have at some point. The bigger, obvious
                displays of sexism haven’t bothered me as much because those are
                ridiculous enough to either laugh at or immediately call out.
                It’s the frequent, little, insidious things people say or do
                that add up to become the most damaging because they’re this
                constant voice of doubt. It’s when people assume less about you
                and your abilities as a default. It’s the times on climbing
                trips when I’m projecting a hard boulder while Pi, my husband,
                is hanging out not climbing, and guys come up and ask Pi
                questions about the climb every time because it’s automatically
                assumed that I wouldn’t be doing something difficult. It’s the
                fact that I still get asked if I need rental shoes at the
                climbing gym, while he’s never been asked. There’s nothing wrong
                with being a beginner, but as a climbing community, we HAVE GOT
                to get away from that assumption that women=unskilled.</strong

                was psyched and asked me to try it with her. She also happened
                to ask at a time when I was feeling frustrated with bouldering
                and minor injuries, so trying a project that’s basically the
                opposite of that (a long endurance trad climb) was appealing. We
                also learned that apparently no women had led Oz before, which
                seemed crazy to us because there are lots of women in the MN
                climbing community who are more than capable of doing that. I
                think as women, we’re socialized from a really young age to
                avoid trying things we don’t think can do, or that we’re not
                100% qualified for. But I mean, if you can try it in a way
                that’s reasonably safe, why not give it a go? Aren’t you
                curious? I hope that some day, what we did will be utterly
                unremarkable, because so many other women will be crushing much
                harder climbs here.</strong

            Girl, I feel that in my soul....<br />Right now, though, it is quite
            remarkable...in fact, please make more remarks about your send.
            Specifically, how'd it all come together?<br /><br /><strong
                >I spent so much time stressing out the week leading up to the
                send that I must have been out of adrenaline when it was time to
                climb. I was a little rattled in the beginning because I racked
                some gear out of order and had to fix it at the first good rest,
                but I was able to pull my head back together and the rest of the
                climb felt surprisingly relaxed. It was one of those great
                climbing experiences were you’re kind of just an observer along
                for the ride while your body just does what it already knows to
                do. In a funny way, being a person who is naturally anxious has
                given me some good mental coping skills for stressful climbing
                situations.</strong

            For all our readers who are inspired now to go for it, describe why
            you choose to go for Oz as opposed to some other leads at
            Palisade.<br /><br /><strong
                >Oz is a beautiful climb. It was appealing to me because the
                rock quality is good throughout most of the route, it has cool
                movement in the lower section, and while there are some runouts,
                the gear is solid and the falls are clean. Neither Rachelle nor
                I had really gotten into trad before because we weren’t
                interested in doing climbs that didn’t feel physically
                challenging. For me, having no endurance, Oz felt challenging
                enough to be interesting, but safe because you’re so high up by
                the time you’re truly pumped and the falls are totally fine. It
                was perfect.</strong

            What was the most challenging part of working Oz?<br /><strong
                >Oh man. The fact that I was totally out of my element! I had to
                learn how to top rope solo, set up anchors that wouldn’t kill
                us, place gear that would probably stay, learn to actually rest
                in hand jams, and learn how to self-rescue by jugging the rope
                when I inevitably forgot to place directionals on the way down.
                It was overwhelming at times! It’s humbling to be in a sport for
                so long and in some ways still be a complete beginner.</strong

                >I’m used to mostly working on boulders by myself, so the best
                part was definitely the social aspect. We had a great little
                crew of friends meeting up there most weekends who brought their
                psych, snacks, and a not-insignificant amount of booze and
                good-natured heckling.</strong

                hive. So, when I’m not working, I’m doing everything in my power
                to disengage from that. In addition to climbing, I’ve been
                reading a lot of escapist fiction books that usually involve
                time or inter-dimensional travel. The weirder, the better. They

                though. Maybe something with more powerful moves and not as
                long. I’m open to suggestions!</strong
