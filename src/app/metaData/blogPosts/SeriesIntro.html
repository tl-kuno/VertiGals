Be on the lookout for our first Woman Crusher Wednesday (WCW) post this
Wednesday! We want to highlight the amazing women that make up our North Shore
VertiGals community; these women are not only climbers but are smart,
passionate, and have a wide range of interests and identities. Climbing brings
us all together but we often don't notice the incredible differences that make
each of us and our community so special. Each week we will highlight one woman,
starting with a few board members and then incorporating the rest of our
VertiGals community as well. We’ll post the full interview here on our new
website, and snippets of the interview on our Instagram
<a href="http://instagram.com/northshorevertigals">@Northshorevertigals</a>.  We
also want to highlight women who we find inspiring outside of the North Shore
community, so each week the subject of WCW will select a few people, podcasts,
blogs, etc. that they find inspiring to be highlighted later in the week. Get
ready to be inspired!
