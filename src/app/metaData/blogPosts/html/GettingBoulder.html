                    We waited under an expansive blue sky at a rickety gate to
                    enter Hueco Tanks State Park, the legendary bouldering
                    destination outside El Paso, Texas. We entertained ourselves
                    with yoga and with a dangerous variation of catch with heavy
                    rocks (builds finger strength, the boys said!), in the
                    middle of the deserted road. Finally, we were allowed into
                    the park. We started climbing as the sky turned red, and the
                    pink syenite boulders reflected the sky.

                    I had been nervous about the trip. My best friend Erin and I
                    were invited by two friends, prominent climbers in our
                    community. I felt privileged to be there. It was an
                    opportunity to learn from the best. But I was worried that I
                    would hold the others back, or wouldn’t be able to climb
                    what everyone else wanted to climb. I hadn’t been bouldering
                    for long. The guys climbed harder than I did to start, and I
                    had recently injured my rotator cuff. It healed, but I
                    hadn’t had time to train for the trip. I had lowered my
                    expectations for the trip. I didn’t want to get frustrated.

                    At Hueco Tanks, Erin and I fell in love with bouldering. We
                    bruised our legs on knee bars and bat hung on horizontal
                    roofs. We did yoga in the sun on hot bedrock. I stubbornly
                    tried a single move one hundred times before I got it, with
                    only a few tears in the process. When rain came, we hid in a
                    cave and played on the classic Baby Martini until the sun
                    returned. We admired the ability, the try-hard and the
                    endless enthusiasm of our new friend Julie, who we met
                    there. Erin sent the awkward Hourglass with a healthy
                    10-armed spot and came down with the biggest grin I’ve ever
                    seen.

                    And at the end of each day, we gathered with Dos Equis beers
                    around the long table in the house at Hueco Rock Ranch and
                    talked about bouldering, of course.

                    But when Erin and I thought about our community back in

                    gym, seeing another woman, much less a group of them, in the
                    bouldering area was rare.

                    Bouldering with the guys was fun, but could be frustrating.
                    Their beta didn’t help my short curvy body, but made me
                    question my instincts and skills when they sprayed it
                    anyway. After all, they had years more experience than me.
                    When I tried hard, they helpfully told me they <em

                    was just a little too scary for me, I felt worse for failing
                    their expectations.

                    Erin said instead: You can do it; but if you don’t want to,

                    We mulled over the idea, and back home, we decided a women’s
                    climbing group should exist. We created a Facebook group for
                    women climbers in the area, and started talking about it to
                    anyone who would listen. For the first group climb, 15 women
                    showed up. A year and a half later, over 130 climbers are
                    involved in the group, now officially the North Shore
                    VertiGals.

                    As our group was forming, we weren’t alone. Women across the

                    climbing gatherings, and connected thousands of female

                    The VertiGals has brought all kinds of women together to
                    climb, share beta, share meals, do yoga, have fun, and
                    support one another. The VertiGals are each women who bring
                    something different, valuable, and inspiring to our group.
                    VertiGals events mean talking for hours about empowering
                    women to advance their skills, increasing access for people
                    of all backgrounds, and improving our local crags.

                    And as for feeling privileged to tag along on a climbing
                    trip with some good climber dudes; that’s just silly. All I
                    need is a bouldering pad and some try-hard, and I can climb
                    whatever, wherever, and with whomever I want. I belong at
                    the crag just as much as any other climber there, regardless
                    of my gender or if I’m working on a V0 or a V15.

                    My privilege lies in the fact that I am an able-bodied
                    person with the means to climb at all and that I have found
                    supportive climbing partners and friends of all kinds in my
                    community who inspire and help me grow.

                    In March, a year after the VertiGal’s first meeting, a group
                    of us traveled together to another legendary bouldering
                    destination, Bishop, California, for the FlashFoxy annual
                    women’s climbing festival. At the festival, climbing with
                    dozens of strangers; women of different skills, ages,
                    backgrounds, and colors; I couldn’t help but notice feelings
                    of support, instant mutual trust, friendship among climbers.
                    And the feeling was really good. I took home a commitment to
                    keep climbing with more women, more often.
