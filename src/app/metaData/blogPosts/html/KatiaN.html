<h6>Interview written and compiled by Stephanie Hall.</h6>
Katia Nartovich is this weeks WCW! Katia is always up for all sorts of
adventures; climbing, snow kiting, sailing, dog sledding, canoeing, backpacking,
acroyoga, and the list goes on. If there's good music happening in town, she's
at the show, and she's always excited if there's good food around! She recently
graduated with a degree in Computer Science and while she's waiting to find the
perfect job in that field she's working as a Sled Dog Musher this winter, after
spending her 7th summer working at Camp Olson YMCA. Fun fact about Katia, she
grew up speaking both English and Russian. Katia has done some fun traveling for
climbing; she was one of the VertiGals that went to the Flash Foxy Women's
Climbing Festival in Bishop, CA last year, and this past fall she took a
climbing clinic in Kalymnos, Greece with Sasha DeGuillian. We interviewed her
for our first ever trip report, coming out tomorrow, be sure to check it out!

<b>What do you love about climbing/what does climbing mean to you?:</b>

I love that climbing is so versatile! Whether you’re tall, short, strong,
flexible, etc., there is a style of climbing that can play to your strengths.
And whether you like to boulder, lead, multi-pitch, trad, whatever, there are so
many different ways to get involved! I find a lot of empowerment in climbing,
and I’ve met some pretty awesome and inspirational people through the sport
(many of them through VertiGals). [caption id="attachment_570" align="alignnone"

<b>How did you get started climbing?</b>

I started climbing kind of on accident. My little brother got involved before I
did, and since the only gym in Rochester at the time was all the way across
town, my parents bought me a membership so they wouldn’t have to drive him back
and forth all the time. I climbed throughout most of high school, but when I got
to college I had trouble finding time for it. After I graduated, I stumbled
across the VertiGals, which motivated me to get back into climbing. I still go
through times when life takes over and I don’t get on the wall very much, but I
always come back to it as soon as I can! [caption id="attachment_558"

<b
    >Share a story of an impactful climb or experience you've had related to
    climbing (good or bad), or an experience you're proud of.</b
>

One of the very first times I went climbing outdoors was at Section 13 my
freshman year of college. For those that haven’t been, the climbing at Section
13 is a top-managed belay system, meaning you start at the top of the climb and
rappel down. At first the climb was going pretty well, but then I got stuck --
really stuck. There was a section that I kept attempting over and over again,
but I could not figure out a way past it. At this point, I was still far enough
down that I couldn’t see my belayer at all, and on top of that, it was
ridiculously windy, so we couldn’t hear each other either. I had no way of
communicating that I needed help. I felt so alone. I didn’t really have a choice
other than to keep trying the section until I finally got past it. This is just
one example of a time when climbing forced me to realize that I was stronger or
smarter than I thought. That’s one of the things I love about the sport - it
never fails to push you to your limits, both mentally and physically. [caption

<b
    >How are you hoping to grow as a climber or what skills are you hoping to
    develop?</b
>

I strive to be a well-rounded individual in my life, and climbing is no
exception. I don’t necessarily feel the need to be the best at anything, but I
love to experience as many things as I can. I want to keep working on expanding
my climbing horizons, learning from as many people as possible!
