<h5>Interview written and compiled by Stephanie Hall</h5>
This weeks WCW is another of our earliest members to join our community, Megan
Lidd @meglidd! Megan has been coming to our events essentially since we started
and has been a great asset to our VertiGals community. Megan has also been doing
great things in the Duluth community through her work as a Recreation Specialist
for the City of Duluth Parks and Recreation. It seems she's got the perfect
career for her, as all of her favorite hobbies include being outdoors;  hiking
and backpacking (especially on the SHT!), camping, sailing, kayaking/canoeing,
skiing (downhill/cross-country), and she is hoping to add mountain biking to the
list this year. She also enjoys traveling to new places, a good cup of coffee,
and those glowing Lake Superior sunrises. Another goal for this year, climb
outside! Something tells me she won't have any problem finding some awesome
friends from this community to get on some real rocks with this summer :)

Climbing a grain silo in Iowa! (Unknown photographer)[/caption]

<strong>How did you get started climbing?</strong>

I went to school at the University of Northern Iowa, and climbed a little bit
there, but not consistently. I did a couple outdoor climbing trips, and even
took a 1 credit ice climbing class -where in classic Iowa fashion, the side of a
grain silo was hosed down to form our ice. After college, I taught outdoor
education for a few years and facilitated high ropes challenge courses and some
climbing. I’ve belayed thousands of kids and adults in all sorts of settings,
but hadn’t been the climber/participant for a while until moving to Duluth in
2017. Duluth’s access to outdoor recreation is one of its best qualities. I’m
excited to embrace all that it has to offer – including climbing!

<strong>What do you love about climbing/what does climbing mean to you?</strong>

One of my favorite parts about climbing is the combination of the mental and
physical challenge. Some days more mental, some days more physical and
regardless of where you are on that spectrum climbing provides you a space to
focus, test your limits, set new personal goals, and feel accomplished. I also
love how climbing plays to people’s individual strengths and weaknesses
differently. It’s fun discovering new ways to look at the same problem and
figuring out what works best for you. [caption id="attachment_667"

Crushing it on that yellow 5.10, you know which one![/caption]

<strong>What made you join/ get involved with VertiGals?</strong>

After I moved to Duluth and started climbing again, I caught wind of the
formation of the group. I was looking to make friends, meet climbing partners,
and it seemed like an awesome group of positive people! I was fortunate to be in
on some of the early planning meetings of Vertigals, and have enjoyed watching
the group morph and develop. Climb nights at Vertical Endeavors are always a lot
of fun! Whether you’re completely new to climbing, or a regular climber, you can
always find a connection with someone as a climbing partner, fellow Duluthian,
or new friend. [caption id="attachment_89" align="alignnone" width="450"]<img

One of our earlier climb nights, so many faces that were strangers and are now
friends (including Megan!)![/caption]

    >How are you hoping to grow as a climber or what skills are you hoping to
    develop?</strong

Just in the past few months I’ve finally tapped into the 5.10s in the gym! One
of my top goals is continuing improve my footwork and overall technique in order
to keep making progress. Also, I’m hoping to check out a few local crags this
summer!
