Interview written and compiled by Stephanie Hall How many of you are lucky
enough to know Meg AKA
<a href="http://instagram.com/megacarnage">@megacarnage</a>? This week we are
switching it up and focusing on an awesome woman who is a former member of the
Duluth climbing community. Our VertiGal and North Shore Climbing Communities
reach far outside of Minnesota as there are many who have wandered away from
Duluth yet still consider this community to be their own. We celebrate those
members as well! Traveling, climbing and working at new gyms, meeting new
climbers, exploring new craigs, learning about different local climbing ethics,
and generally being a part of a different climbing community allows insight not
just into the places you travel to, but also allows you to see your own
community through a new lens. With this in mind, we will occasionally be
featuring women who have moved away from or have recently moved to our community
to highlight the great experiences outside of Minnesota as well as to provide
insight into our own community. Back to Meg! Meg lived in Duluth from 2010-2015,
then worked at Roca Climbing Gym in Rochester for a bit before heading West. She
now lives on the road, mainly hanging out in AZ, NV, and UT. Working as a
freelance writer, editor and transcriber has allowed her to work wherever she
happens to be, as long as she has access to internet. Being on the road also
means she is able to pursue her other passions of trail running, backpacking and
hiking, along with writing, reading, and cooking. Soon she'll be heading out on
another adventure, this time to pursue teaching (and surfing!) in Costa Rica.

<b>What is the best part about where you live/climb now? </b>

The best part of where I live right now is that I can live in the location I
feel like going next. Well, as long as I have access to the internet so I can
make some money now and again.

<b
    >What do you miss about North Shore climbing or the Duluth climbing
    community?
</b>

I miss some of my closest friends that I made when I was living in Duluth and
climbing every summer, all the time! I really miss those people and the
community we built together. The great thing is that we have continued that, and
are still close friends. It's great to always have people down to go on an epic
trip! I can also say that I genuinely miss climbing at Palisade Head. It really
is unlike anywhere else I've climbed. I am SO in love with the desert right now,
but I do often think fondly of climbing above the crashing waves of Lake
Superior. I love and miss Duluth whole-heatedly, and I consider it my true
Minnesotan home. I have been gone for a number of years now, and I don't fully
know what the community is like anymore. I truly hope that it continues to be an
open-minded and welcoming place that allows for deep learning and friendships. I
will say that most Minnesotan climbing communities are much different than other
ones across the country but in a good way. The people of the North Shore are one
of a kind! [caption id="attachment_442" align="alignnone" width="960"]<img

<b
    >What do you not miss or what would you improve now that you’ve experienced
    other climbing areas and communities?</b
>

Although most of the climbing community I found while I was in Duluth was
through climbing and working at Vertical Endeavors, I would say that the gym
needs a hell of a make-over. I've visited and worked in a number of different
climbing gyms across the country, and the standard for the climbing community
has moved far beyond dirtbaggary. I also know that VE has since opened a new
boulder gym in Minneapolis (that they spent too much money building for what
it's worth, plus contracting out most of the work to Vertical Solutions), but
they could focus most of their money and energy in their already existing
communities, such as the Duluth VE. [caption id="attachment_433"

<b>What is something about your climbing history no one would ever guess?</b>

I get pretty severe anxiety when climbing in large groups or around too many
people.

<b>What do you love about climbing? </b>

I love that it's for anyone at any ability level. Things have changed so much in
the climbing world in just the last ten years. Climbing is such a pure activity
when you're outside. It encompasses the body, mind, spirit, and camaraderie. You
can find Jerry's and jerks in any hobby, but if you venture outside the gyms,
sport, and boulder crags, you are able to truly connect with yourself, the rock,
and other climbers. [caption id="attachment_439" align="alignnone"

<b
    >How are you hoping to grow as a climber or what skills are you hoping to
    develop?</b
>

I am hoping to climb a big wall or two next year or the year after (so basically
within the next two years). I am also beginning to pursue Alpine. This will be
difficult with my upcoming move to Costa Rica, but hopefully, I will be heading
to Alaska in May to chase some alpine lines. There is always room to grow and
learn as a climber, and I love that. That drive to continue learning is the only
way I keep developing and pursuing the sport. [caption id="attachment_435"

<b>What is the climbing experience you are most proud of? </b>

The climb that I am most proud of is a 5.10 trad line in Sedona, AZ. Now I know
that grade doesn't sound overly impressive on paper, but those of you that have
led any trad line in Sedona will know why I'd be proud of that. Anyway, I don't
generally gravitate towards difficult trad routes of any sort. I'm more of a
5.fun kind of gal on trad, but I was climbing with one of my AZ area climbing
partners and we were swing leading a 4 pitch climb. He led the first, I led the
second, he got the money pitch, and then I finished it off to the top of the
tower. To be honest, I had no idea what the rating of any of the pitches was
going into this. He knows the area really well, and just brought us to a climb
he knew we were capable of achieving, and one he thought I'd find enjoyable,
plus it had an amazing view. In my head, I was assuming he'd never take me on
anything harder than a 5.9 given my current physical condition and my trad
leading nerves, but he threw me out there on both of the hardest pitches.

Squamish, BC. Unknown photographer, submitted by Meg Carney.[/caption] I had a
few difficult spots on the second pitch, but it really was only hesitation and
me second guessing myself before the crux move. I didn't fall, and after that
things went smoothly. The third pitch was one an amazing dihedral, and then we
were almost done!  The first half of the pitch was a breeze for me, and I
enjoyed it quite a lot. With about 50 feet left to go, I moved out of the crack
I was climbing onto a face that gradually became a sandy, mud-stone slab. There
was a bolt after a while that eased some of my nerves, but things just kept
thinning out the higher and higher I climbed. I remember looking down at that
bolt I was so happy for and thinking, "wow that must be at least 20 feet.
Hopefully there's another bolt soon... and hopefully, I don't fall because that
would really suck." Since I was on a slab, I really had no other choice than to
climb up or fall. There's not much of an option to down climb and regroup. There
was quite a bit of deep breathing after I looked up and could see the chains
that were at least 20 more feet above me with no more opportunities for
protection in between. I climbed carefully and methodically, and by the time I
reached the chains, my legs were shaking. They weren't shaking because I was
tired, but because that was the most scared I've ever been on a climb. Most
climbs I had done up until that point had been much better protected, and most
trad climbs allowed for protection when I wanted. I am most proud of that climb
because had I known the grade of the climb or done any research prior to that
day, I would have told my partner to pick something else. I never would have
attempted to lead any part of it. I would not have tried it because I wouldn't
have believed I could complete it successfully. When my partner reached the top,
he was stoked I did so well. He told me he had picked this route because<strong>
    I am more capable than I perceive myself to be, and sometimes we need an
    unknown challenge to tell us that.</strong
>
He did also admit he had forgotten that the final pitch was the scariest, but
he's glad I had to lead it and not him. After that day, I have pursued harder
things and doubted myself less often.
