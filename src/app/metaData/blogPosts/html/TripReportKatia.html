<h5>Interview written and compiled by Stephanie Hall and Karina Krosbakken</h5>
We're doing a new thing! We're trying out quick interviews about climbing trips
our community members have taken. Climbing can take us to far reaches of the
world, to climbing meccas, to unknown crags, and even to places within our own
communities we've never explored. Getting out, getting on real rock, and
expanding our knowledge is always a recipe for a great adventure! Our first trip
report comes to us from Katia Nartovich (yesterdays WCW), from her trip to the
Greek Island of Kalymnos to join a climbing clinic with pro-climber Sasha
DiGiulian. [caption id="attachment_551" align="alignnone" width="5475"]<img

        >The rock is limestone with lots of tufas! Fun to look at and fun to
        climb on. There was a huge variety of climbing: slab, vertical,
        overhung, something for every climber, style- and difficulty-wiseThe
        entire island is swarming with climbers! Practically every other shop
        sold name-brand climbing gear -- probably the widest selection I've ever
        seen. Everything is catered to climbing: massages, food, etc. They even
        had climbing comps playing on all the TVs in one of the restaurants we
        went to.</span

        >Incredible! Haha I was a little star-struck at first. I saw Sasha out
        and about the night before the retreat officially began and I was too
        nervous to approach her. She had a lot of really useful tips for
        everyone in the group (the only prerequisite was being able to climb
        5.9/5.10 so the group was pretty diverse skill-wise). I was impressed
        with how well she was able to articulate exactly what she was doing and
        why it worked. I think a lot of people who are really good at what they
        do have trouble explaining it to or teaching other people, but Sasha
        doesn't have that problem. She hung out with us outside of the climbing
        day and went to dinner with us every night, so we got to establish a
        more personal relationship, which made the teaching aspect seem more
        natural. It was also really awesome to watch such a high-caliber athlete
        perform in person!</span

        >"Heels down!" Haha that was something that was repeated over and over.
        Most of the people in our group were stronger climbers than I was, which
        helped push me to try harder climbs than I might have otherwise. Having
        stronger climbers around in general is a great motivational tool! After
        the retreat I feel more comfortable falling on lead, because Sasha and
        our climbing guides had us intentionally fall over and over again to get
        used the feeling. They also taught us how to be better belayers when
        catching falls (more slack = softer fall!)</span

        >I spent all summer working at a camp two hours away from the nearest
        climbing gym, and the two months leading up to the retreat traveling,
        which meant I hadn't been regularly climbing in nearly five months! I
        was also feeling burnt out from being on the road so long, and that made
        it hard to focus on climbing. Coming in so unprepared wasn't ideal, but
        by the end of the week I had found my groove.</span
