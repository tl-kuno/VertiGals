                >Crack climbing. Ooooh yes. A beautiful hand jam or fingers that
                goes for days. I also like the fight of offwidth climbing and
                chimneys. Overall I love multi-pitch trad, preferably miles from
                the road so I have to hike in, really get to know my partner,
                get an alpine start, probably be cold en route, eat tuna at
                pitch 5, lose my way, climb up chimneys covered in bird poop
                (sorry about that one, Angie), say hi to a bat three pitches up
                inside of a crack while on lead, and hopefully top out to
                incredible views and probably wind.<br />And, of course,
                probably getting lost on the way down. Or rained on. Or hailed
                on.</strong

                >I was in Yosemite on a rest "weekend" (we'd do 5 days "on" of
                climbing and 2 days "off"), which meant that my partner and I
                were hiking peaks that were 4th class and below. We started up
                one of the peaks near Lee Vining in beautiful weather with
                hiking poles and overnight backpacking gear. Getting in to the
                peak was fantastic- beautiful hike, amazing mountain views, and
                camping on snow, which I loved. We hit the peak the next morning
                and started down, which was where the trouble was. Because it
                was so sunny and beautiful the day before, the big steep snow
                field we had post-holed up the day before had melted and then
                frozen overnight into a giant sheet of ice probably 2 football
                fields high, with steep chossy cliffs on either side at a 45
                degree angle with no real way down. We didn't have crampons, so
                walking straight down the steep ice field was out of the
                question. We finally decided to very carefully hike along the
                edge of the cliff and the ice, which worked until we were about
                halfway down and the ice had separated away from the wall
                because of the warmth of the day heating up the rock the ice was
                pushed up against. At that point, we had to climb down between
                the ice and the wall, shoving our packs up against a vertical
                piece of ice with our hands and feet pushing up against the
                wall. We stayed as close to the top of the ice as possible while
                basically chimneying against the ice. If we had fallen, we would
                have slipped down between the ice and wall for a good 15-20 feet
                before sliding under the ice, which would not have been great.
                Needless to say, probably one of the most terrifying moments
                I've ever had. We had to shuffle along like that for probably 20
                feet until we could crawl out again. I had a new appreciation
                for my pizza that night to celebrate not sliding under the
                ice.</strong

            Tell me about your "Cold Water Scuba Diving" because that sounds
            like a PEAK Duluth hobby: <br /><br /><strong
                >In Spring of 2019 (we didn't get to do it this year because of
                COVID), I went scuba diving in Lake Superior under the ice when
                it was completely frozen. I was with an amazing group of dive
                friends, and despite the outside -10 degree air (and -20 or
                something windchill), we cut a hole in the ice and did dry-suit
                diving under the ice. Diving for me is kind of terrifying and
                forces me to mentally keep my brain calm, so diving into this
                cold silent world under the ice was exhilarating and daunting
                (and really cold), and I'm very proud of myself to mentally do
                that. Plus blowing bubbles under the ice and playing with them
                where they collect is really fun.</strong

            Word on the street is that you are redoing the Minnesota Climbing
            Guide Book! That's awesome! Tell us about your decision to take that
            on?<br /><br /><strong
                >It was a combination of events. Falcon Guidebooks put out the
                call for an author when the previous author decided he didn't
                want to do the new update. I originally did not want to take it
                on; I know how much work it is to do a nonfiction book like
                this. I wrote a guidebook a couple years ago called North Shore
                Adventures that gives suggestions for the best climbing, hiking,
                mountain biking, canoe/kayaking, and scuba diving from Duluth to
                the Canadian Border on the North Shore. It's a lot of time,
                research, interviews, organization (LOTS of organization), and
                work. I knew this would be the same. Luckily, I had
                encouragement from others that I would (hopefully!) be a good
                fit. First was the encouragement from the photographer for the
                new update, Angie Jacobsen. She would partner with me to take on
                the parts of the book that I knew would be overwhelming for me
                with a full teaching load--the photos and the topos--and I could
                focus on the writing, revisions, and the research. I had a lot
                of climber friends encourage me as well since I spent years
                climbing on the North Shore and I am very talkative with
                climbers I don't know, so Angie and I interviewed with Falcon, I
                submitted a writing sample, and we were hired.</strong

            Have there been some challenges to redo the guide book?
            <br /><strong
                >The anticipation to properly make a manuscript that I hope
                really represents Minnesotan climbers has been a little
                daunting. I want the guidebook to be useful, thorough,
                informative, and let the character of each place be truly
                captured through the descriptions of the area. I want all
                Minnesota climbers to feel proud of their local crag when they
                read the finished book. So no pressure… right? :) Another is the
                sheer amount of organization of LOTS of details involved can at
                times be overwhelming. Last, getting out to climb during COVID
                has made things far more challenging.</strong

            Why did you choose to redo the guide book as opposed to only
            updating an online platform like Mountain Project?

                >I'm probably not a good person to ask about this. I collect
                guidebooks from every place I've climbed in the US and in the
                world (If anyone needs to borrow a Kalymnos, Greece or Dolomites
                guidebook, just ask!), and I'm an English teacher that loves old
                fashion in-my-hand books. I make notes in my books and press
                leaves between the pages and put a sticker from Miguel's in the
                inside cover, and when I borrow out my guidebooks, I encourage
                friends to leave traces of their own adventures in the pages
                with pen, pencil, food and coffee stains, or mementos. I've also
                climbed in a lot of places with no signal to get Mtn Project. I
                believe a guidebook should be used in partnership with an online
                platform like Mountain Project. I absolutely love Mountain
                Project as a collective forum for updates, beta, suggestions for
                campgrounds, etc, but nothing beats shoving a guidebook on the
                top of your pack for an old school reference tool.</strong

            So when you aren't being a professor, being an author, or being a
            coach....any skills you are working on in your spare time in
            climbing? <br /><strong
                >I'm not great at dynamic moves or the parkour-type bouldering
                stuff. I'm short with a negative ape index, and with my dance
                background I'm way better at static controlled moves or moves
                that require flexibility. I live near MBP and have been able to
                practice some more dynamic movements, but I'm still terrible at
                them. I'm also hyperflexible, so if I come down from the top of
                a boulder bad or miss a parkour move, things can pop out of the
                socket easily. Jumping for a big parkour move is a possible
                months-long recovery. Dynamic moves are a mental training thing
                just as much as physical for me.</strong
