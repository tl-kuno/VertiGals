    Say goodbye to 2020 and HEY HEY to Molly Watkins! Molly is an Alaskan turned
    Duluthian who has 100 hobbies. She's a nordic skier, climber, hiker, trail
    runner, canoe-r, and flutist! This year she "started dabbling" in mountain
    biking and triathlon training! We met her at a VertiGals climb night and we
    love that she's always down for adventure and a challenge. <br />Read on to

            Fast Facts<br />Favorite MN climbing spot:
            <strong
                >Banning State Park has some fun boulder problems (and pretty
                views!)</strong
            ><br />Favorite crag elsewhere:<strong>
                Smith Rock in Terrebone, Oregon.</strong
            ><br />First time climbing:
            <strong>6th grade, Kenai Middle School gymnasium.</strong><br />If
            you had a million dollars, the first big purchase you would make is:
            <strong>Index fund in my Roth IRA.</strong>

            Let's just jump right in (ha - photo reference) What are some
            climbing skills you are working on? How?<br /><strong
                >My crimp strength is pretty low. In this current COVID-y time,
                I am primarily working on it when carrying groceries in from the
                car; why make two trips when you can carry it all in one and
                improve your grip strength!</strong

        <p>
            LOL Yes! Speaking of COVID - did you pick up a "Pandemic
            Project"?<br /><strong
                >I started exploring mountain biking this summer. I kept hearing
                it was the thing to do in Duluth, so figured it was time to give
                it a try! I’m still fairly cautious (I like my collar bones
                intact), but slowly getting the hang of it. Zooming along trails
                on a mountain bike is much preferable to indoors
                Zooming.</strong

            So many hobbies! Now adding mountain biking! Love it...why do you
            climb?<br /><strong
                >Climbing is an efficient strength workout, with the added
                benefits of improving flexibility and challenging the mind. It’s
                also fun to be able to set goals on routes and see progress over
                time.</strong

                over technical expertise. I love corners, chimneys, and routes

                climbing I have done has mostly occurred unintentionally on
                hikes when I should have read the map more closely. But Palisade
                Head looks pretty spectacular. And I figure there is no better
                way to gain outdoor climbing skills than having the only way out

            Palisade Head is our JAM here at North Shore VertiGals...but it can
            definitely be a little intimidating or scary for new outdoor
            climbers. Have you ever had a super spooky experience here in MN?
            <br /><br /><strong
                >This summer I ran into a bear on the Superior Hiking Trail
                while running alone in the dark with dim headlight batteries
                (last minute decision to make my virtual Grandma’s Marathon
                attempt before the deadline). I’ve heard Duluth bears are much
                friendlier than Alaska bears, but it definitely was startling
                when I rounded the corner and saw glowing eyeballs 20 feet away!
                Fortunately, after a brief staring contest it headed off into
                the woods. Made for a rather jumpy next few miles,
                though.</strong

            [For some background, the Birkie is the American Birkebeiner. It's
            the largest cross-country ski race in North America, and one of the
            longest. #NotAnAd but the Birkie is pretty sweet, just sayin.]

            When you aren't climbing, skiing, biking (or apparently unicycling)
            you are a Physical Therapist. Let's end this by having you shout out
            for us your favorite stretch or exercise**!<br /><br /><strong
                >For climbers I often recommend strengthening the wrist
                extensors. Climbing requires a lot of wrist and finger flexion
                strength, but grip strength can be improved (and injury risk
                reduced) if wrist extensors are strong as well. Reverse wrist
                curls with a dumbbell and finger extension against a thick
                rubber band are good ones to start with. For runners and skiers,
                hip abductors are often the weakest link (keep up the bridges,
                single leg step-downs, and clamshell exercises!)</strong
