<h5>Interview written and compiled by Stephanie Hall</h5>
This weeks WCW is a badass not just because of the grades she’s climbing but
because she still finds time to climb in the midst of the full life she leads
outside of climbing. Sheryl Filby Williams (<a
    href="http://instagram.com/sherylfilby"
    >@sherylfilby</a
>) is one of those people that you always wonder how she possibly has enough
time to do all of the things she does. She is a Senior Hydrogeologist and Vice
President at Barr Engineering Co. here in Duluth, she’s a wife and a mom to two
active kiddos, a mountain biker, hiker, she crews on a sailboat for Wednesday
night races, takes her kids on adventures near and far, and somehow she still
finds time to climb. Her energy and enthusiasm is infectious, and 20 years of
climbing experience and her life experiences make her a great partner for a
mid-day climb session.

<strong>What made you join VertiGals?</strong>

I was really excited to see a women’s climbing group start in Duluth.  Through
my career as a woman scientist, I’ve seen how important it can be for women to
support each other in areas they have historically been underrepresented. My
daughter looks up to the great women climbers in Duluth so much; she is very
proud to climb with the VertiGals (see Reija's Mini WCW interview below!) &nbsp;

    >You've been climbing for a long time, how has climbing changed for you as
    you've grown older and grown your family?</b
>

I first took at climbing class in college (over 20 years ago) and climbing has
been a part of my life since then. Climbing has always been a great way to
socialize and stay strong.  My climbing involvement has ebbed and flowed over
the years but I always seem to come back to it. Currently, I’m fortunate to work
for a great company where I have flexible work time, so I can sneak in a workout
during the day at VE when time allows.  I also try to bring my kids in the
evenings. It’s hard to fit everything in with a career, personal interests, and
family, but
<strong
    >by sharing my passions with my kids, I can combine time on the wall with
    family time.</strong

Ice Climbing in Bozeman, MT in 2002[/caption] My kids have been climbing since
they were really young-<strong>
    it’s one of my greatest joys as a parent to share my passion for outdoors
    activities with my kids.</strong

When I’m with my kids, the climbing is all about them – keeping it light and
fun.  But I still love to climb just for me. I will always enjoy pushing myself
mentally and physically.

<b
    >As a mother, how do you think your daughter's experience in the outdoors
    will be different than your own? What do you hope is different?
</b>

I grew up being considered a “tomboy.”  I was very outdoorsy and athletic. I
think the difference now is that my outdoorsy and athletic girl (age 7) can be
just that – an outdoorsy and athletic <i>girl</i> –
<strong>who doesn’t have to associate any part of that being for boys</strong>
(and she does still love pink and dressing up).  Both my kids have gravitated
towards the outdoors. Nothing makes me happier as a parent to be out with my
family on the trail backpacking or skiing together. We have been very
intentional about bringing our kids on outdoor adventures from a young age – now
it’s just part of their lives.

<b>What changes good or bad have you seen in the Duluth outdoor community?</b>

Duluth has always had a strong outdoor culture, but it’s only grown more
vibrant.  I feel very fortunate to live in a place where my kids’ sports are
skiing, mountain biking, and climbing.  We live right on Lester Park and the
ability to be on the trails, river, or big lake right from our house is so
unique and incredible.

<strong>What are some of your other non-climbing hobbies/passions?</strong>

In the summer we like to mountain bike and enjoy local swimming holes.  I also
crew on a sailboat for Wednesday night races. In the winter, we do all kinds of
skiing. I picked up telemark skiing last winter so that’s my latest challenge.
 My family loves to travel and we just finished our first family backpacking
trip in Zion National Park in October. My husband and I also backpacked in the
Dolomites in Italy a couple years ago.
