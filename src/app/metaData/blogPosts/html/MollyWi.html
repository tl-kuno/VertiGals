what her handle means if you run into her at the gym sometime ðŸ˜Š ). Molly is a
water resource scientist who fills her free time adventuring outside climbing,
trail running, hiking, paddling, and cross country skiing. When sheâ€™s not
outside she is writing, dying yarn, knitting (Check out her side gig

<strong>What made you become involved with VertiGals?</strong>

I'm one of the founders of the VertiGals. It was my friend Erin's idea. When she
brought up the question of why there was no women's climbing group in the area,
I couldn't let it go. I was frustrated with how long it had taken me to get into
climbing and the barriers to entry that had kept me out: It was crazy
intimidating. Once I did get into it, I realized a lot of the reason it took so
long was because climbers (like many other outdoor sports) can have a macho,
elitist attitude that makes it difficult for new climbers to get into. This is
especially true for women because the sport has historically been dominated by
men, and if you don't see people like yourself doing something, you assume there
must be a reason. My first few climbing partners were women. After I started
climbing with more with men, I realized that climbing with women and climbing
with men are totally different experiences. One is not better or worse, but they
are definitely different. I found a lot of value climbing with women and seeing
other women struggle, overcome their fears, succeed, and support each another.
But after my first few partners stopped climbing for various reasons, it wasn't
easy to find other women climbers in the still male-dominated sport. Being a
climber fundamentally depends on having a strong community in order to find
partners. Despite our ingrained gender bias (we all have it), our local
community is generally welcoming and wonderful. Which is probably why we felt
comfortable and empowered enough to try to make some changes.Â  Thus the
VertiGals were born, to make it easy to find female climbing partners and
friends, and offer a safe place for women to push themselves at all levels of
climbing from beginner to advanced. [caption id="attachment_257"

    community?</strong

I would really like to see a place to poop at Palisade Head! For the many folks
that spend the entire day up there climbing, pooping is inevitable! The bedrock
shrubland ecosystem has very shallow soils and is sensitive to disturbance from
excess nutrients. Palisade Head isn't that big, so the impacts are focused in a
relatively small area along the top of the climbing routes. The high
concentration of climbers in the summer takes its toll on the sensitive species
that live in that ecosystem. A bathroom on site would help alleviate some of the
pressure of both climbers and other visitors on this fragile, beautiful system
that everyone loves. ***In the meantime, please note the nearest public bathroom
is at Tettegouche State Park, 2 miles north of Palisade Head. We highly
recommend all climbers learn about and practice Leave No Trace ethics. ***

So many goals! I originally wanted to be a better, stronger, harder climber and
climb higher grades. I still want to be a "good climber", but I am realizing
that climbing hard grades isn't really my top priority because I just don't have
fun when I take it too seriously. I am more interested in fun than achieving
perfection. So instead, I'm currently focusing on maintaining my (perfectly
fine) current abilities, and advancing skills like anchor-building and managing
fear. I want to become more confident in sport leading, but I am realizing this
takes a long time! And, I want climbing to take me all around the world to new
and beautiful places.

<strong>What women or woman produced projects inspire you?</strong>

Kathy Karlo <a href="http://instagram.com/inheadlights">@inheadlights</a> is an
inspiration for so many reasons. This piece of hers really spoke to me when I
read it:

I love Connie Sun's comics which offer a commentary on climbing and on just how
hard life can be.

I'm into Georgie Abel's writing and her all around bravery taking on challenging
mountains and even more challenging topics.
