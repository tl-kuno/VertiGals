<h5>Interview written and compiled by Stephanie Hall</h5>
This weeks WCW is none other than the brainchild behind VertiGals, our
Co-founder Erin Hammes! Erin might seem quiet when you meet her, but she's
secretly hilarious and not-so-secretly full of great ideas. Erin loves gardening
and running when she isn't climbing or working as a nurse, and if she seemed
tired when you ran into her this summer it was probably because she worked and
overnight and then worked at shift at the CSA farm. Erin also suffered a bad
injury due to a lead fall and has had a long road to recovery in the past year.
We all love the community that has been created thanks to her idea! [caption

<strong>What made</strong
><strong> you decide to create what would eventually become VertiGals?</strong>

I met my good friend, Molly Wick, at Vertical Endeavors.  We bonded over our
love for bouldering. Her and I were on a trip to Hueco Tanks together, and began
wishing we had a greater source of support for female climbers locally.  If you
want to know more about that, read Molly's article "Getting Boulder"
(https://medium.com/@mollywick/getting-boulder-dc457c08d4a2), you won't regret
it! [caption id="attachment_330" align="alignnone" width="960"]<img

    >What would you like to see change in the Duluth/North Shore climbing
    community?</strong
>

Experienced women step forward as mentors to those wanting to climb outside. 
Climbing outside can introduce new barriers for the beginner climber: seeking
out someone with experience and some basic (but expensive!) equipment...to name
a few.  This can make it feel elite and intimidating.  It is a personal goal of
mine to work toward breaking barriers that prevent beginners from climbing
outside... and who better to teach women than other women? I have had some
pretty darn fantastic mentors over the years, but looking back I realize that
95% of them are dudes.  WHAT.  I know plenty of women in our small climbing
community that are not only super strong beasts, but have a wealth of technique,
experience and climbing knowledge.  And to top it off, they are good
teachers...They have a unique way of supporting/pushing one another that is not
overbearing...They are able to work their way through a climb creatively (sure,
climbing "powerfully" can make you feel badass, but there is something to be
said about watching someone climb with stellar footwork or utilize hip
flexibility to get a crazy high foot and make it through a sparse crux)...These
women are feisty and deliberate. So my word of encouragement to the ladies with
some experience is to be proud of what you know and your unique strengths as a
climber.  Celebrate that.  Maybe even flaunt it a little bit.  Make yourself
approachable to the curious new climber.  Correct the person that automatically
assumes your dude climbing partner set the anchor.  Continue to build your skill
set.  These things might seem trivial or cliché, but they also just might set
the stage for some impactful mentorships that are empowering for both parties.

    >You had a pretty significant accident in El Potrero Chico last year, has
    that affected you mentally at all while lead climbing or affected how you
    feel about climbing? How have you been able to move past any anxieties or
    struggles with that?
</strong>

Kind of funny to be talking about this today, because this week marks the one
year anniversary of my climbing accident.  Uff-da.  Toward the end of the trip I
took a fall on lead and the impact crushed a bone in my ankle requiring surgery
and a whole of hardware.  Basically I have a bionic ankle now.  My prognosis was
poor. I vividly remember my surgeon telling me it was unlikely I would run &gt;2
mi again.  The immediate recovery period was a horrible combination of feeling
anxious about how my ankle was healing and not being able to exercise to get rid
of that antsy feeling.  Is reading this a buzz kill for you yet? Cripes. But,
life goes on.  Several weeks post surgery, when my bones were somewhat together
again, I began climbing.  I would hop on in with my crutches and then climb one
footed.  I probably looked like a nut job. My foot was too fat and fragile to
fit into a climbing shoe so I wore this awful boot contraption that was
worthless for edging.  I will never forget how good it felt to climb in shoes
again and be able to tolerate the pain of standing up on my toes.  Fast forward
to the present and I am fairly close to my former climbing shape (and running 6
miles...so that's pretty neat).  Sure, a hard day of climbing still leaves me
hobbling around for several days like an old lady, but it just plain feels good
to be climbing again. My latest and greatest obstacle has been overcoming the
fear of re-injury.  Before the accident, I would have considered myself
primarily a boulderer and somewhat gutsy.  I secretly enjoyed a good dynamic,
powerful move and thought falling was kind of exhilarating.  But now, a fall in
which I might land on my ankle at a goofy angle or fall from a significant
distance is out of the question.  I think to the outsider, that might seem
silly.  It has been an entire year...Get over yourself.  But, my stability and
flexibility in that ankle is still poor, and I am highly prone to rolling my
ankle.  It will likely be another year before the soft tissue around my ankle is
close to normal again.  So, I have been playing around with leading and
bouldering again, but with things significantly below my range of abilities. 
And, I still have to give myself little pep talks.  A lot of them.  It's been
frustrating... even more so than the physical healing.  But it has also been a
good lesson in patience and being gentle with myself. My biggest take away from
the whole experience is self awareness while climbing.  I had such an adrenaline
rush during the accident, that it is difficult for me to remember the details of
what made me fall and why my foot got so mangled.  Was I pushing myself too hard
or being reckless? Was it slabby?  Did I land on a tiny ledge?  Did my belayer
have me extra tight?  The details of the actual accident aren't important.  What
IS important is the perspective I have gained because of it.  I have a much
greater appreciation for anticipating what a fall would look like at any given
point during a climb.  And a huge respect for those that are able to evaluate a
situation and decide NOT to continue because things don't feel quite right. 
That takes guts AND brains. &nbsp; [caption id="attachment_351"

<strong>Favorite local crag</strong>: Governor Dodge State Park in Dodgeville,
WI.  Beautiful sandstone...good range of difficulty...and a bit quieter than
Devil's Lake.  It's great. CHECK IT OUT!! I own a copy of the MN/WI Bouldering
Guidebook and would love to lend it to you!  I also have a soft spot for
Palisade Head, my first introduction to the world of outdoor climbing. There is
a unique energy that comes with climbing over Lake Superior on a warm summer
day...just be prepared to be filmed by drone and bombarded by tourists.  Darn
it. [caption id="attachment_329" align="alignnone" width="960"]<img

<strong>Other non-climbing hobbies/passions:</strong>

One of the best ways for me to deal with the stress of life is to throw on a
pair of trail shoes and get lost in the woods for a few hours.  Winter is my
favorite running season! I am also fanatical about plants and getting my paws in
the dirt! I have created some pretty crafty pocket gardens over the years as a
renter, and this last year I got a seriously gross farmer's tan and calloused
phalanges working at a CSA in Wrenshall.  If I get to know you well enough, I
just might borderline harass you to create a garden of your own (win-win?).
