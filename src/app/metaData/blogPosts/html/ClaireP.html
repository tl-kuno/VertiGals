    she used to be one of the friendly faces that welcomed you to VE-Duluth, or
    maybe you've seen her climbing hard, training, or dry-tooling in the gym,
    but did you know she is also a full-time student? She has only been climbing
    for about three years but she grew up going to circus camp learning aerials
    and contortion (she even had a rope and aerial hoop in her backyard), and
    the need to climb and play eventually lead her to the UMD climbing wall once
    she got to college. Currently she's working on her degree in Special
    Education and Elementary Education, but she's still finding time to train
    and climbing competitively. In November Claire took 2nd place at the UMD
    Drytool comp in the advanced category, and most recently Claire qualified
    for the

<p><b>What do you love about climbing?</b></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
    <b> </b>I love that climbing is always a physical and mental challenge. Even
    when you accomplish something, there is always something harder to do. I
    also love the local climbing community. Everyone is so kind and willing to
    share their knowledge and time with one another.

    I started ice climbing last year at the UMD drytool comp. I was a little
    unsure about it at first, but then I went outside a few times and I was
    hooked.

<p><b>How did you get into competition climbing?&nbsp;</b></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
    Two years ago started participating in a few rock climbing comps. Last year
    I had a lot more time, so I went to a few comps in the Wisconsin Indoor
    Climbing Series, the UMD drytool comp, and several other events. In March I
    went to the 2018 North American Ice Climbing Championships. At this
    competition I had my first experience with speed climbing and kicking into
    plywood. The best part was meeting athletes who regularly compete in ice
    climbing. They inspired me to apply for the US ice climbing team.

<p><b>How do you train differently for rock climbing vs ice climbing?</b></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
    This summer when I was training for rock climbing, I climbed outside as much
    as I could. I also tried to climb in the gym frequently. I was not training
    for anything specific, so I was just trying to have fun and improve my
    skills. For ice climbing, I have been doing kettle bell training 2-3 days a
    week (similar to cross-fit). My drytooling/ice climbing schedule has been
    more random, but I get out at least a couple times a week. I try to do a few
    swimming and running workouts every now and then as well.

        >How are you hoping to grow as a climber or what skills are you hoping
        to develop? </b
    >My current ice climbing goals are to lead ice, climb multi-pitch ice
    routes, and become more competent in leading drytool routes. For rock
    climbing, I want to become a more diverse climber, and I want to do some
    multi-pitches.
    <strong
        >But at the end of the day, my greatest goal is just to have fun, meet
        new people, and gain confidence in myself</strong
    >. In this whole training process, I am learning that it does not matter how
    I climb at any competition, or how I compare to anyone else. Each and every
    small accomplishment that I experience along the way matters. It is about
    personal growth and trusting The Lord through every clip and every
    micro-pullup!

    Palisade Head- great views, great memories, great routes. I love the
    combination of crack and face climbing that is offered here.
