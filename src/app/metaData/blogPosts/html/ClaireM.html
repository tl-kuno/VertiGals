            My first time climbing was almost five years ago at Shovel
            Point.&nbsp; I was working my first summer at Sawbill Canoe
            Outfitters in the Boundary Waters. A couple of the other crew
            members were climbers and would use their free time to climb at
            nearby Carlton Peak and Shovel Point.

            I was interested in trying and joined them on their outing to Shovel
            Point one day. I will never forget the complete gripping fear I felt
            when I had to scoot my butt off the edge of the cliff to lower down!
            I climbed with them a couple more times that summer, loved it
            despite (maybe because?) of the fear and adrenaline I initially
            felt, and then started climbing at the gym at the U of M after the
            summer ended, and outdoors whenever I was able!

            In a lot of ways to me climbing is another way to experience the
            outdoors and connect with people. I think climbing can lead to a
            unique connection with others through shared goals and the sense of
            camaraderie you have when
        </p>

            you are encouraging each other and trusting someone with your
            safety. I also love how climbing combines physical and mental
            strength. There is always something to work and improve on, but at
            the end of the day for me it is about enjoying myself and spending
            quality time with others outdoors.

            was a trip to Horseshoe Canyon Ranch in Arkansas that a close friend
            and I planned and prepared for. I had been on several climbing trips
            before it, but always with climbers who were much more experienced
            than me and would set up the top rope anchors/would lead all pitches
            and I would follow. The trip to Horseshoe Canyon Ranch was my first
            trip where I was of equal experience and skill with the other person
            I was climbing with, and we equally took turns who was
            leading/anchor building and following/cleaning. My friend and I
            started preparing months in advance, pushing each other to become
            stronger sport climbers and practicing our anchor set up and
            cleaning. The climbs we did were not the most difficult I’ve done in
            terms of rating or most dramatic location, but experiencing that
            preparation together and then the feeling of independence during our
            trip was the most satisfying climbing I’ve ever done!

    There is so much I want to learn! From a technical perspective, one of my
    main goals is to gain the competence and confidence to safely set up top
    rope anchors unassisted. I am also trying to increase my confidence as a
    sport climber-- working through the fear that is often present for me,
    practicing taking safe falls, etc.&nbsp; Someday down the road, I would be
    interested in dipping a toe into trad climbing-- not because it seems fun
    (it seems mostly terrifying), but because I like how it aligns with Leave No
    Trace ethics.

            After going to college in Minneapolis and growing up in the Twin
            Cities, I knew I wanted to live somewhere with better access to the
            outdoors after graduation. After working at Sawbill Canoe Outfitters
            for three summers, I had spent lots of time exploring the BWCA and
            the north shore and fell in love with the area. Duluth has pretty
            much everything I could ever want-- great proximity to the
            BWCA/outdoor activities, stunning scenery right in town, interesting
            character, tons of beautiful old houses and architecture….The past
            year in Duluth has confirmed to me that there is nowhere better!
