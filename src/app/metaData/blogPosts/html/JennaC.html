<h6>Interview written and compiled by Stephanie Hall</h6>
This weeks WCW is one of our amazing climbing mamas,
<a href="http://instagram.com/jennacav">Jenna Cavallin</a>, who also happens to
be one of the kindest women you'll meet in our community. Jenna is a biologist
at the EPA Mid-Continent Ecology Division here in Duluth, where she works on a
research team that studies how fish reproduction may be impacted by exposure to
chemicals in the environment. Jenna loves to hike, cross country ski (which she
did a LOT of during the recent government shutdown!), downhill ski, travel and
explore new places, and she is also mom to 20-month-old Britta. Britta is well
on her way to being an adventurous person herself; she loves to hang out in the
backpack while Jenna and her husband Ben hike, and she went on her first
climbing trip to Canada with Jenna when she was just 3 months old! Hopefully
that is the start of a lifelong love of climbing, adventuring, and being at home
in the outdoors.  Jenna is hilarious, smart, and makes the best chocolate
chip-nutella cookie you've ever had, and she'll also be at this weeks

>! Full disclosure here, while I know and am friends with all of the women
featured on the blog so far, Jenna is one of my closest friends, and I have
climbing to thank for that! We met while working at the EPA but didn't really
become friends until a bunch of coworkers all started climbing together. The
first time we ever hung out just the two of us was driving out to Ely's Peak to
meet friends to go climbing, and from that moment on our friendship was
unstoppable. Over eight years later our friendship has expanded to include many
experiences outside of climbing, but we still climb together almost every week,
and we are as close as ever. I mention this because it is an example of the
amazing friendships that can grow through climbing, especially when women
support each other, make space for each other, learn together, build each other
up, and care for each other. [caption id="attachment_596" align="alignnone"

<strong>What do you love about climbing/what does climbing mean to you?</strong>

There’s a lot to love about climbing!  When I first started climbing, I viewed
it as just an alternative style of working out in the gym, but as I’ve spent
more time climbing, I love the camaraderie that goes along with it. I’ve met
some of my closest friends through climbing, and I think a lot of that comes
from trusting and respecting the person on the other end of the rope. It’s
definitely a sport that requires focus, support, and trust, both as the climber
and the belayer. I also love that you can see your own progress. I really enjoy
trying new routes, working on them week after week (through some level of
frustration, of course), and finally, the satisfaction that comes from
successfully completing the route clean. And finally, I love that climbing
allows me to spend more time outside and explore new places. I feel my happiest
when I’m outdoors and being able to spend a full day outside at the craig fills
my cup. [caption id="attachment_530" align="alignnone" width="1381"]<img

<strong
    >How has climbing changed for you after having your daughter either mentally
    or physically? What surprises did you have getting back into
    climbing?</strong
>

One of the biggest surprises for me as I started climbing again after my
daughter’s birth was how much my mindset changed. I guess I had anticipated the
physical challenges that I would encounter while getting back into climbing
shape (no ab strength at first!), but it really took me awhile to feel like I
was mentally back in the game. After taking 5 months off, I had a difficult time
trusting my feet again. I was constantly afraid my feet were going to slip off
the wall.  Another mental challenge that I was not expecting at all was
realizing my self-importance to another human being.  While climbing, I was
fearful of falling, injuring myself, or worse, given that this tiny person whom
I love beyond words was reliant on me. I felt very protective of my health.
Although I felt very timid at first, I’m finally getting over these mental
hurdles and am calmly climbing again. [caption id="attachment_527"

<strong>What is your favorite local craig and why you love it?</strong>

Thunder Bay, Ontario!  OK, not exactly local, but we’re close enough to Canada,
eh? For the last four summers, I’ve enjoyed a weekend of climbing in the Thunder
Bay area (Pass Lake, Silver Harbor, Claghorn).  I love everything about those
trips: the drive up the North Shore, the diversity of the rock type between the
different craigs, the beautiful views, and of course, the delicious Canadian
poutine! [caption id="attachment_524" align="alignnone" width="3456"]<img

    >Share a story of an impactful climb or experience you've had related to
    climbing (good or bad), or an experience you're proud of.</strong
>

This past summer I had an experience at Palisade Head that encompassed both
failure and success, and ultimately, left me with a feeling of accomplishment.
First of all, although I really enjoy climbing outside, I get pretty nervous
about rappelling. Given the fact that you have to rappel to the base of the
climb, along with a few personal reasons, I had had no interest in climbing
there in previous years. For some reason though, last summer, I was determined
to conquer this fear and just go for it. With a lot of support from my friends
and after a few "warm-up" routes at Shovel Point, I finally did it; I rappelled
and climbed Palisade Head! Surprisingly, the rappel was awesome!! I was so
excited and proud of myself as I lowered to the shore of Lake Superior. At that
point, I switched gears and started focusing on actually climbing my way out of
there. I made it about half-way up the climb before I fell, and unfortunately,
given the position of the rope, I wasn’t able to swing myself back onto the wall
to attempt to continue the route. [caption id="attachment_536" align="alignnone"

Rapping down Superior Crack, Palisade Head 2018. PC Dan Villeneuve[/caption]
There I was, dangling in the air, half-way up the cliff, feeling hopeless and
completely embarrassed. Prior to climbing that route, my fellow climber friends
had explained to me how to ascend the rope if needed and provided me with the
appropriate gear. It all seemed crystal clear until I was stuck in the situation
where I actually needed to use it while hanging in the air. Long story short, I
ended up being lowered back to the bottom of the cliff, where I waited for one
of my dearest friends to rappel down to give me a pep talk and a hug. She
explained to me that there was another route our friends could set up just a few
yards away that I could climb instead. Without hesitation, I opted for the
easier route and climbed out with my shaky limbs, bruised ego, yet
self-satisfaction that I give it my best effort and conquered my fear of the
rappel. Maybe next year I’ll do it again. :)

We are all constantly tackling our own fears and I'm proud to have watched Jenna
continue to push through her fears over the years, and to have had her by my
side as I push though my own. Cheers to the strong bonds that climbing creates!
