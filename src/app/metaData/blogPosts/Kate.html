    It’s starting to feel a lot like summer! Which means outdoor climbing,
    paddling, and camping! Thinking about camping got me to thinking about
    campfires. Thinking about campfires made me think of our responsibility to
    Leave No Trace and prevent forest fires! And that got me thinking of our WCW
    Kate! Kate is a wildland FIREFIGHTER. Dope, right?! Right now she's out in
    Washington State and we were able to catch up with her right before she went
    offline for a week! So, Kate, you'll see this in a few days :) Read more to
    learn about our #WCW Kate below!

            I have the privilege of being able to use my job as a way to train
            and stay "in shape." Being a wildland firefighter allows me to work
            my body pretty hard on a daily basis. So, luckily, it's easy to stay
            motivated when your job, personal safety and crew safety relies on
            it.&nbsp;

            I have been dreaming/planning of bikepacking the Baja Divide in
            Mexico! A friend and I started planning about a year ago to complete
            it last winter (and we were lined up to help raise funds for the
            Cairn Project, which is an awesome account to follow!) but with
            COVID we decided it wasn't the best timing. Still hoping to do it in
            the near future, but we'll see.&nbsp;

            not really, but kinda." I'm at a point in climbing where I enjoy it,
            and I'm starting to lead super easy routes. Which an exciting point
            to be at, but because I move so much for work, I feel like I have
            never really had a constant group of people to mentor/teach me.

            Yeah! I usually tell people I'm a nerdy wildland firefighter, but,
            to put it simply, I am on a fire ecology crew. I have this awesome
            position where I go out and fight wildfire about half the time, but
            I also get to collected pre/post vegetation data to see how our
            forests are changing after a fire goes through. Which is such a cool
            position, and in my opinion, super important for our public land
            with climate change. <strong>(IT'S AWESOME!)</strong>

            I think I would tell people it seems glamorous, (especially the
            whole van life thing) but it can be really hard and it's not really
            glamorous at all. It's a lot of sitting in laundromats, trying to
            find potable water, and finding "the best dispersed camping spot." I
            think the main takeaway is to try to not have any pre-established
            ideas of what "adventure" looks like because adventure is whatever
            you want it to be.&nbsp;
