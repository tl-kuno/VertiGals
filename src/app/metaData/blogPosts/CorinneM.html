                started climbing at Vertical Endeavors St Paul. From there I
                went to a number of camps that including climbing trips. My
                first experience climbing outside was at Shovel Point when I was
                in 7th grade.</strong

            2020 has been a wild year, for lots of reasons, but you had a baby
            in 2020! Congrats! Tell us about having a baby in a pandemic?!<br /><strong
                >It is a very weird time to bring a human into the world! While
                we were at the hospital we pretty much forgot about the
                pandemic. We were not planning on having visitors at the
                hospital, so none of our plans changed in regards to the
                hospital stay. I was very worried that Kelly was not going to be
                able to be a part of the birth, but thankfully I was allowed one
                support person. But once we left the hospital it was very hard.
                When we pictured bringing our baby home from the hospital we
                pictured having family and close friends surrounding us to offer
                support and love our baby. When we got home we felt very
                isolated and I became very sad. I was mostly sad that others
                couldn't hold or meet Riley. After a few weeks and we learned
                more about how the virus spread we started having family meet
                him. Once all his close family members had been introduced and
                were able to hold Riley I started feeling so much better about
                the situation. We were so thankful that our families were being
                safe which made us feel good about the introduction. Over the
                weeks we have been introducing him to close friends we know are
                being safe. We just love watching him meet all of the wonderful
                people in our lives.</strong

            How has becoming a mom changed or impacted any of your climbing
            goals?<br /><strong
                >Climbing has become a family activity for us. A new climbing
                goal of mine is balancing climbing and new baby. My goal is to
                continue being passionate about climbing while introducing
                climbing to baby. It has been an adjustment to slow down a bit,
                but it has been so fun to watch him become more comfortable with
                climbing life.<br />A big focus since April is our new baby. A
                major focus has been introducing him to new and exciting
                adventures and watching him grow to love being outside. It is so
                fun to introduce him to adventures we love and watch him learn
                more and more! I cannot wait to see what he enjoys doing and
                what interests we will share.</strong

                Kelly is also doing babies and boulders with some of his friends
                and they are taking the babies out to bouldering spots around
                Duluth. The babies sit in their bouncer seats and the dads

                like climbing, that he has a good safety foundation. I would
