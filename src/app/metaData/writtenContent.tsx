        history: [
            `The Vertigals were founded in 2018 by Erin Hammes and Molly Wick with the goal of fostering an inclusive space for women climbers in the Twin Ports region. The founders wanted to give women the opportunity to learn from and climb with other women at local gyms and crags while giving back to the local climbing community by promoting climbing safety and diverse climbing perspectives.`,
            `Since then, the Vertigals have organized many community events, including Climb Nights at the local climbing gyms, outdoor climbing clinics, and social gatherings at board member’s homes. They also partner with local businesses to put on their signature fundraiser, the Nuts of Steel Rock Climbing Film Festival, which brings climbers together for a night of relaxation, raffle prizes, and tasty food and drink.`,
            `The NorthShore Vertigals are also committed to encouraging women in the outdoors on and off the wall and are often found at local events across the Twin Ports. Come say “Hi” when you see  us wearing our merch out and about!`,
